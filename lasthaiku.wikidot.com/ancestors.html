<p>Ancestors are a special form of Spiritual Advantage, and are purchased with Character Points in the same manner as other Advantages. They represent guidance and advice from great heroes of Rokugan's past who now dwell in Yomi. Only a rare and exceptional character should receive an ancestor's guidance, and players who choose this option will be subjecting their characters to significant role-play restrictions. Ancestors are powerful, but the constraints they place on characters may be frustrating to many players, especially given their high point cost. Ancestors do not apply to the maximum number of advantages that a player may purchase during character creation.</p>
<p>All ancestors are governed by the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Loyalty:</span> An ancestor will only advise someone from the same clan/faction. They will not aid those who are not part of the clan they served (and in some cases, founded) in life, even if that person can claim a direct blood descent from them.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Piety:</span> A character who has an Ancestor is expected to offer veneration and devotion on a daily basis. In general, any character with an Ancestor Advantage should expect to spend at least one hour a day in prayer and devotions. The GM can allow this requirement to be set aside when unusual circumstances dictate (character is in the Shadowlands, on a ship in a storm, etc), but the character must make amends with renewed prayers as soon as he is able. If a character consistently fails to offer veneration, the Ancestor will abandon him - the character will have to spend at least a month in devout prayers and atonement in order for the Ancestor to return.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jealousy:</span> Only one Ancestor will ever advise a character. Further, if the favor of that Ancestor is ever lost, no other Ancestor can be purchased to replace it - the character's failing will be known in Yomi, and other Ancestors will disdain to approach him, no matter how noble his later deeds.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Demands:</span> All Ancestors place specific demands on the characters they help. In return for the Ancestor's potent aid, the character must live a life which accords with the Ancestor's beliefs and principles. If a character fails to meet these demands, the Ancestor leaves, perhaps forever. At the GM's option, a character that shows sincere repentance and devotion - typically at least a month of devotions, as under &quot;Piety&quot; above - can regain his Ancestor's favor. However, a character who fails to follow the Ancestor's demands a second time will be allowed no further chance to atone.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="toc0"><span>Crab Ancestors</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hida [14 Points]</strong></span><br />
Hida was a warrior of unmatched strength and endurance, who relied on that to defeat all foes, never backing down from any of them, even his own Taint-corrupted son. With Hida watching over you, your blows strike hard and true - you gain +1k0 to all damage rolls and may ignore 4 points of an enemy's Reduction, regardless of what weapon you are using. Further, any Crab who fights alongside you in a skirmish are inspired by the spirit of Hida which infuses your frame, and gain +1 bonus Void Points (if they do not use this Void point by the end of the skirmish, it is lost).<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Any Round that at least one fellow Crab is wounded within your sight, you must suffer 1 Wound in sympathy. (This does not increase if multiple Crab are wounded in the same Round.) This Wound ignores Reduction and any other effects which would otherwise negate damage. However, you can voluntarily choose not to suffer the Wound. If you ever refuse to suffer these Wounds, or if you ever voluntarily retreat from a fight with a creature of the Shadowlands, Hida will abandon you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hiruma [11 Points]</strong></span><br />
The man who founded the Hiruma family was a pragmatic warrior who employed speed, precision, and stealth to defeat powerful foes. His guidance makes it easier to follow in his footsteps, granting you a +1k0 bonus to your Stealth, Kenjutsu, and Kyujutsu skill rolls.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> If Hiruma watches over you, you can never willingly betray the Crab Clan or he will abandon you. However, as a pragmatic warrior who eschews many of the niceties of Bushido he will also abandon you if your Honor Rank ever rises higher than 5.0.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kaiu [9 Points]</strong></span><br />
The legendary master craftsmen who forged the Crab Clan Ancestral Sword that slew Hatsu-Suru no Oni. Kaiu founded the most potent engineering school in the Empire and his descendents built the Great Carpenter Wall. Kaiu's guidance grants you a +3k1 bonus (instead of +1k1) any time you spend a Void Point on a Craft or Engineering skill roll. In addition, once per game year you may call on Kaiu's inspiration and roll an appropriate Craft skill at TN 50 to create a minor awakened nemuranai. The initial powers of this magical item are chosen by the GM, but should start out weak (e.g. +1k0 to skills or damage, for example) until the spirits within the item grow stronger over time.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Kaiu abhors mediocrity, laziness, and failure. You must never deliberately produce Craft/Engineering work that is lest than your best. This obviously includes keeping low dice on a skill roll but will also have many subtler role-play applications; such situations should be adjudicated by the GM.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kuni [8 Points]</strong></span><br />
The founder of the Crab shugenja school was a capable shugenja and a man who knew more about the creatures of the Shadowlands than any other. Once per session, you may spend a Void point to gain a bonus to your spellcasting roll equal to your Earth Rank in kept dice. Also, when rolling to resist gaining the Shadowlands Taint, you may roll twice and keep the better result.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Kuni's demand to his descendents is a simple one - stay pure. If you ever gain so much as a single point of the Shadowlands Taint, Kuni will abandon you.</p>
<h1 id="toc1"><span>Crane Ancestors</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Asahina [9 Points]</strong></span><br />
A powerful and talented Phoenix Clan Fire shugenja who forsook the ways of violence and married into the Crane Clan, Asahina became one of the Empire's foremost advocates of peace. His family maintains his traditions to this day. Asahina's spiritual guidance grants you a +1k0 bonus on Mediation Rolls and a +1k1 bonus to Spell Casting Rolls when casting a non-damaging spell with the Craft or Defense keywords.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Asahina expects you to live up to his ideals of absolute pacifism. If you ever willingly and deliberately harm a living creature, even a tainted creature, he forsakes you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Doji [8 Points]</strong></span><br />
The Lady Doji created most of the rules and concepts of Rokugani civilization, and her influence is still felt throughout the Empire's courts in the present day. Those who receive Doji's advice gain a +1k0 bonus to all of their Courtier, Etiquette, Perform, and Sincerity rolls.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Doji requires those who have her guidance to live in a manner both honorable and civilized. If you ever commit a Major Breach of Etiquette, or you ever lose more than 3 points of Honor or Glory from a single breach of etiquette, Doji will abandon you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Doji Hayaku [7 Points]</strong></span><br />
Doji's youngest son, the founder of the Daidoji family, was a skilled warrior who spent two years hunting for his lost sister Konishiko. He ultimately retrieved her sword (and her soul) from the Shadowlands, but in the process he lost his voice and his hair turned white. Hayaku's guidance grants you a +1k1 bonus to Lor: Shadowlands rolls and a Free Raise on all attacks with Spears.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> You must honor Hayaku's sacrifices by dyeing your hair white. You can never abandon, betray, or endanger a member of the Doji family (or your charge if you are a yojimbo) - if you do, Hayaku abandons you in a fury.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kakita [12 Points]]</strong></span><br />
Doji's husband was both a duelist and an artisan of renown, author of <em>The Sword</em>, and served as the first Emerald Champion in Rokugan's history. Hoever, he also started the Crane Clan's long and bitter feud with the Lion Clan. Those who have Kakita's guidance may spend a Void Point to re-roll any Iaijutsu or Artisan Skill roll with a +1k1 bonus to the second roll. They keep the better result. However, all those who are watched over by Kakita earn the automatic enmity of Matsu samurai, who sense their own ancestor's anger - all members of the Matsu family are effectively Sworn Enemies to you.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Kakita was an honorable man who sought perfection in both the sword and with the artist's brush, and he expects the same of you. If you ever lose a duel or an artistic competition, Kakita forsakes you. He also abandons you if your Honor ever drops below 4.0.</p>
<h1 id="toc2"><span>Dragon Ancestors</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Agasha [6/10 Points]</strong></span><br />
The founder of the Agasha family was an isolated researcher who studied the Elements and learned their secrets. Although much of her family joined the Phoenix, she remains loyal to the Dragon and appears only to those of her descendents found within that clan. Agasha's insights into the true nature of the Elements grant you a +1k0 bonus to Spell Casting Rolls with non-Void spells and +1k1 bonus to all Spellcraft Skill Rolls.<br />
If you spend spend 10 points on Agasha as an Ancestor, you are one of her most favored descendents and learn the secret spell &quot;Transmute.&quot;<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Agasha was a pacifist, and if you ever serve in war she will abandon you. However, she was once kidnapped by goblins, so she will not abandon a descendent who wages war against the Shadowlands (only).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Agasha Kitsuki [11 Points]</strong></span><br />
The founder of the Kitsuki family originated the concept of the controversial &quot;Kitsuki Method,&quot; which uses logical deduction and inference to solve crimes. Those who have his guidance gain the ability to &quot;read&quot; others and pick up on subtle, hidden clues in an uncanny, almost supernatural manner that many samurai find disturbing. When you have Kitsuki's guidance, you may use your Perception Trait for any Skill or Trait roll that would normally require you to use your Awareness Trait. Furthermore, if you spend a Void point on any Skill or Trait roll to tell whether someone is lying to you, you gain +2k2 instead of the normal +1k1.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Kitsuki requires you to always pursue the truth. If you ever accept a solution to a problem, crime, or puzzle that you know or sincerely believe to be false, Kitsuki will abandon you.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ikoma [9 Points]</strong></span><br />

You gain +1k0 to all rolls you make with the Intelligence Trait, and +2k0 to your damage when fighting unarmed (with the Jiujutsu skill).<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kaimetsu-Uo [9 Points]</strong></span><br />
The original founder of the Mantis Clan was the son of Hida Osano-Wo and his Matsu bride, and one of the most formidable warriors of his day. Preferring actions to words, he carved a clan's founding out a dangerous tropical island, and stormed Kyuden Isawa to avenge his father's death. Those who gain Kaimetsu-Uo's favor are expected to live as he did, carving their way through life with action and sheer determination, using whatever weapon comes to hand, and countenancing no insult form anyone.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Moshi Azami [6 Points]</strong></span><br />

Prior to the twelfth century Azami is solely an ancestor for the Centipede Clan.

<strong>Demands:</strong> Azami was a profoundly pious woman. She will leave you if you commit any act of impiety or blasphemy against the Fortunes or the Celestial Heavens (deliberately or accidentally).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Osusuki &amp; Akomachi [5 Points]</strong></span><br />
The two ancestors known as Osusuki and Akomachi were actually kitsune spirits who forged an alliance with the nascent Fox Clan. They took human form, one man and one woman, and married into the Kitsune family, bonding the two groups by blood forever. Their guidance will only be bestowed on members of the Kitsune family who can claim a direct blood connection. The attention of Osusuki and Akomachi allows you to speak with animals and animal shapeshifter spirits; furthermore, their wisdom allows you to always find food and water in the wilderness.<br />

<h1 id="toc5"><span>Phoenix Ancestors</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Asako [5 Points]</strong></span><br />
Shiba's favored follower, Asako, learned the secrets of humanity's limitless potential from her lord, and founded the mystic order known as the henshin. She treasured friendship above all things, but for this very reason felt the pain of betrayal more deeply and keenly than any other. While Asako guides your steps, others find you a charming ally and a true friend. Any of your Ally Advantages gain a free +1 increase to their level of Devotion, and you gain +1k0 to all Social Skill rolls made against someone with whom you are an Ally. However, if an Ally ever betrays you, you automatically gain Drive: Destroy the Betrayer for no points.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Asako requires you to treat your friends with the same devotion as you expect of them. If you ever betray or abandon a friend, Asako will forsake you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Isawa [12 Points]</strong></span><br />
The man known as Isawa was unquestionably the greatest shugenja in Rokugan, perhaps in the world, at the time the Kami fell to earth. His power over the elements was one of such potency that Shiba, a son of the Heavens, bent knee and pledged to protect Isawa's line for all time in order to gain his aid against Fu Leng. Those who are honored with Isawa's guidance against +1k1 on all Spellcraft (Spell Research) rolls and learn 1 additional spell each time they gain a Shugenja School Rank.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Isawa was a proud man who believed his family's magic superior to all others. He abandons you if you ever lose a magical or scholarly competition with someone who is not themselves of the Isawa family.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Naka Kaeteru [10 Points]</strong></span><br />
The man called Kaeteru lived when the Empire was young. His thirst for knowledge led him to wander the Empire as a monk, learning all he could and passing it on to others who wished to learn as well. Although it was never his intention, he gathered many followers and students and became known as a great teacher. Eventually he was invited to the Phoenix Lands so they might learn from him as well. Due to his incredible wisdom and experience, Kaeteru was named the first Grandmaster of the Elements by the Phoenix, and awarded the spiritual title of Naka.<br />
The first Grandmaster of the Elements spent much of his life in simple contemplation of the Elements. If you are honored with his guidance, his enlightened insights allow you to use the Meditation skill (two hours, skill roll at TN 30) to regain 1 Spell Slot in each Ring.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Kaeteru was detached from mortal concerns and will abandon any descendents who becomes too involved in worldly matters. This may be represented mechanically by your character acquiring more than 3 Skill Ranks in Courtier or any Merchant or Low Skill. Role-play can and should impact this as well, and the GM should adjudicate whether a character with Kaeteru's guidance is involving himself too deeply in worldly affairs such as politics or money.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shiba [9 Points]</strong></span><br />
Known for his wisdom, perception, and foresight, Shiba served the Isawa faithfully in life, and wrote down the Tao, which became the foundation of the Empire's religion. When he perished in the Shadowlands, he found a way to pass on his knowledge to his descendents, ensuring the Phoenix would always be well-led by the soul of Shiba. However, he also sometimes chooses individual Phoenix samurai to benefit from his guidance. Those who are watched over by Shiba gain +1k1 to all Intelligence Rolls and Intelligence-based Skill Rolls, and may add their Intelligence Rank to their Armor TN at all times. If you enter a skirmish alongside a member of the Isawa family, you gain +1 Void point (this Void point must be used by the end of the skirmish or it is lost).<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Shiba requires that you maintain both a high honor and an absolute, unswerving dedication to fulfilling his oath to the Isawa. If your Honor Rank ever drops below 4.0, he will abandon you. He will also abandon you if you ever willingly disobey a higher-ranking Isawa, or if you ever voluntarily leave a skirmish while an Isawa ally remains behind.</p>
<h1 id="toc6"><span>Scorpion Ancestors</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bayushi [12 Points]</strong></span><br />
The founder of the Scorpion Clan was known for his subtle cunning and trickery, as well as a sort of cruel honesty that he employed most famously at his brother Hantei's deathbed. Although his skills and ruthlessness in both battle and politics were legendary, he also carried a life-long devotion to his follower Shosuro, and her corruption by the Lying Darkness led him to his own death. If you are trained in one of the Bayushi Schools (such as the Bayushi Bushi or Bayushi Courtier schools, for example), you gain a +1k0 bonus to all you School Skills, and any time you spend a Void Point on a School Skil, you gain +2k2 instead of +1k1. If you have a Kharmic Tie with another character, both of you may use each others' Void Points, but if one of you dies, the other immediately gains the Momoku Disadvantage for no points.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Bayushi made only one demand of his followers - loyalty. He expects the same of you. If you ever voluntarily and knowingly betray the Scorpion Clan, he will abandon you. He will also abandon you if your Honor ever climbs to 5.0 or better - such pure souls have no place in the ranks of Rokugan's designated villains.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shosuro [8 Points]</strong></span><br />
Bayushi's most beloved follower was consumed by the Lying Darkness, adn spent centuries imprisoned by the kami Togashi before finally escaping durinr the Hidden Emperor era. At the end of that era, Bayushi carried her soul into Yomi, and since that time she has begun to show her favor to those of her descendents she finds worthy. If Shosure's whispers guide your actions, you gain a +3k1 bonus to all Stealth, Acting, and Sincerity (Deceit) skill rolls.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Having been forced to betray her lord Bayushi once, Shosuro is determined that her descendents will never make the same mistake. If you ever betray the Scorpion Clan, disobey your superiors in the clan, or become corrupted by the Lying Darkness or the Shadow Dragon, Shosuro will immediately abandon you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Soshi Saibankan [5 Points]</strong></span><br />

<strong>Demands:</strong> Saibankan was a loyal Scorpion but also a man deeply dedicated to upholding the law and order. If you ever knowingly break the law or allow another to break it in your presence, Saibankan will abandon you&#8230; unless you did so on the orders of your superiors within the Scorpion Clan.</p>

Yogo joined the Scorpion Clan and started a new family there, studying the techniques that became Yogo ward magic.

<strong>Demands:</strong> Yogo abandons you if you ever fall in love, since this means you will succumb to his curse.</p>
<h1 id="toc7"><span>Unicorn Ancestors</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Iuchi [8 Points]</span><strong><br />
Iuchi studied and mastered the ways of foreign magic, enabling the Unicorn to survive the hostile world beyond the Burning Sands. His insights gave rise to the unique Unicorn style of magic known as meishodo. The guidance of Iuchi is bestowed on shugenja of his bloodline, and allows them to approach Rokugani spells in unconventional ways. While his spirit remains with you, you do not have a Deficient Element.<br /></strong>Demands:** So long as you wish to retain Iuchi's favor, you may never pass up a chance to learn more about magic, even dangerous or blasphemous magic. Just because you know about it doesn't mean you'll use it, after all&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Moto [10 Points]</strong></span><br />
A formidable desert warrior who swore allegiance to Shinjo and brought his tribe into the Ki-Rin Clan, Moto was known for his incredible speed and refusal to be bound by anything but his own choice.

Likewise, any spell which would restrain your physical movement has its Spellcasting TN increased by an amount equal to 5 x your Willpower.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Moto expects you to live by the same standard of freedom as he did, offering obedience only to your lord and clan.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shinjo [8 Points]</strong></span><br />
The founder of the Unicorn was known for her boundless curiosity about the world, which caused her to lead her Ki-Rin Clan out into the Burning Sands, and for her deep compassion, which allowed her to retain sympathy for her fallen brother Fu Leng. After her long imprisonment and sleep in the Burning Sands, she returned to Rokugan to purge the Kolat from her beloved clan. You gain a +1k1 bonus to any Investigation roll made to understand something new, strange, or enigmatic, as Shinjo's spirit guides you to seek deeper understanding of the world around you. You also gain +1k1 to all Awareness rolls made with the Etiquette or Sincerity (Honesty) skills, as Shinjo's compassion infuses you with empathy and grace.<br />
<strong>Demands:</strong> Shinjo requires you to always act with compassion, even when facing bitter enemies. If you ever fail to show mercy and compassion to a rival or enemy, Shinjo will abandon you. (This does not apply to members of the Kolat or minions of the Lying Darkness or the Shadow Dragon.)</p>
