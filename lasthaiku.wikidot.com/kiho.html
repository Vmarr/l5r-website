<h1 id="toc0"><span>Kiho</span></h1>
<p>Somewhere between the spells of shugenja and the martial techniques practiced by bushi, the strange elemental abilities known as Kiho are almost exclusively the province of Rokugan's monastic orders, and are poorly understood by virtually everyone else. While many Kiho represent what an individual is capable of doing when the body and mind exist in a state of spiritual harmony, some represent feats that can only be described as superhuman. Some among the Brotherhood of Shinsei have described Kiho as &quot;stepping stones to enlightenment,&quot; and there may be some truth to that; if they are secrets of the universe that are opened up as one approaches the state of enlightenment, then it could explain why so many seek that near-mythical state with such fervor and devotion.<br />
Typically a member of the Brotherhood discovers several key truths about himself during the grueling physical and mental trials set before him as part of his training and education. This process serves a three-part purpose: it discourages those who are not yet ready to accept the life of a monk, it purges the mind and body of impurities through physical and mental trials, and it helps a new initiate find the first step to one of the paths to enlightenment (the Brotherhood believes there are many such paths).<br />
Kiho are similar to spells and Kata in that they are aligned with a particular Element. By focusing on the essence of that Element within themselves, monks are capable of truly impressive feats. Although Kihos by their very nature are difficult to quantify, they fall into four broad categories.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Internal Kiho</strong></span> represent a monk's ability to align his chi with one of the Elements and in doing so increase his own abilities. They rarely have any visible, external effect other than a sudden increase in the monk's speed, strength, or other attributes.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kharmic Kiho</strong></span> are external in nature, but almost exclusively non-offensive in their effect on others. They are named after the kharmic intertwining of fates that the Rokugani believe many people share.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Martial Kiho</strong></span> are the most overt, and typically are delivered via an unarmed attack. These are powerful abilities that can easily level the playing field between a monk and an armored samurai, particularly if the samurai foolishly dismisses the monk as a non-threat. A number of Martial Kiho are delivered by precise fingertip attacks that inflict little or no damage. These attacks are known as atemi or nerve-cluster attacks.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mystical Kiho</strong></span> are the rarest and most inexplicable of all. There can be no reasonable explanation for the things accomplished by the monks who exhibit these abilities. They are, quite frankly and obviously, supernatural in nature. There can be no disguising the nature of these abilities.<br />
Regardless of type, all Kiho possess a Mastery Level, which determines how difficult it is to master that particular sliver of enlightenment. A monk character adds his School Rank plus the relevant Ring and compares the result to the Mastery Level. If it meets or exceeds the Mastery Level, he may learn that Kiho. Non-Brotherhood characters who may be eligible to purchase Kiho use only their Ring to determine if they may purchase a Kiho.</p>
<h1 id="toc1"><span>Utilizing Kiho</span></h1>
<p>Kiho have an incredible variety of effects, some of which may seem to overlap even between the different classifications. In many ways, they are as inscrutable and mysterious as the monks who utilize them. There are some broad rules that govern Kiho use, however, and make utilizing them a bit simpler in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>A monk character may only have one each of Internal, Kharmic, and Mystical Kiho active at any one time. A monk may have multiple Martial Kiho active at once, but may only ever deliver a single Kiho effect via an unarmed strike per Turn. If a monk has multiple unarmed attacks, however, such as by using Dance of the Flames, then he could deliver a separate Kiho effect via each attack made during the same Turn.</li>
<li>Unless otherwise specified in the description (of if they are atemi strikes), all Kiho requires activation. A Kiho may be activated either by spending a Void Point (as a Free Action), by making a Meditation / Void Skill Roll against TN 15 (counts as a Complex Action), or by making a Meditation / Void Skill Roll against TN 30 (counts as a Simple Action). Spending Void Points to activate Kiho in this manner is considered a School Technique for Brotherhood Schools, and thus does not count against the once-per-round restriction governing Void Points.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of Kiho require successful atemi attacks as part of their activation. This is referred to in the text as the &quot;activating attack.&quot; When making the atemi attack, the monk may either spend a Void Point or make a TN Meditation / Void roll as described above. For atemi attacks, however, these are all considered Free Actions.</p>
<h1 id="toc2"><span>Atemi Attacks</span></h1>
<p>A number of Kiho, primarily Martial but including some of other types, require precise nerve attacks in order to be executed successfully. Because of the exacting precision necessary to execute these attacks, they do not inflict normal unarmed damge; they inflict no damage other than to allow the effects of the Kiho in question to take place. If the optional rules for monks are being used in a campaign, the GM may require atemi attacks to use the Atemi Emphasis of the Jiujutsu Skill. All atemi attacks must touch bare skin in order to be effective. Because of this, all forms of armor double the normal bonus they confer to an individual's Armor TN against these attacks. Kiho that require an atemi attack have the (Atemi) notation following their Ring/Mastery entry.</p>
<h1 id="toc3"><span>Non-Brotherhood Kiho</span></h1>
<p>Kiho are largely the province of the Brotherhood of Shinsei, and Brotherhood monks find these little steps to enlightenment easier than any other.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brotherhood monk characters may acquire Kiho normally as described in the section detailing Monk Schools.</li>
<li>Characters affiliated with other Monk Schools, such as the Dragon clan tattoo orders, may purchase Kiho at one and one half times the normal cost, using the same rules for Mastery Level.</li>
<li>Shugenja characters may purchase Kiho at twice the normal cost, and they use only their Ring to determine if they meet the Mastery Level (rather than their Ring plus their School Rank).</li>
<li>Non-brotherhood characters may never know more Kiho than their total Monk or Shugenja School Rank.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="toc4"><span>Air Kiho</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Air Fist</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Air 3</li>
<li>Type: Internal</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the most basic of all Kiho, Air Fist allows a monk to channel the energy of the wind and lend its speed to his strikes. While this Kiho is active, as long as the only attacks you make are unarmed attacks, your Initiative Score is increased by +5. If you make any other type of attack, the effect is immediately canceled. The damage of all unarmed strikes made while this Kiho is active is reduced by an amount equal to your Air Ring. This effect ends after a maximum of one day.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flee the Darknes</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Air 6</li>
<li>Type: Kharmic</li>
</ul>
<p>A member of the Brotherhood is taught the fundamental lesson of keeping his spirit free from the darkness that can envelop all men. When this Kiho is activated, you become immune to the influence of the Shadowlands Taint (or other supernatural ailments, such as the influence of the Lying Darkness) for a number of rounds equal to your Air Ring. This immunity both prevents you from acquiring the Taint while the Kiho is active, and allows you to ignore all penalties (and benefits) associated with any Taint you already possess while the Kiho is active. If you take any deliberate action that would normally result in the acquisition of Taint, such as casting a maho spell, the effect ends immediately and you gain the Taint as normal.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Great Silence</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Master: Air 4 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Mystical</li>
</ul>
<p>This peculiar technique allows a monk to use a precise attack to disrupt the flow of an individual's chi in such a way that they are unable to speak. This Kiho must be delivered by an atemi attack. If successful, the target of this attack is unable to speak for a number of rounds equal to your Air Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Harmony of the Mind</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Air 5</li>
<li>Type: Mystical</li>
</ul>
<p>A gift often possessed by members of the Brotherhood is the ability to quickly and accurately gauge the strength of others, a useful ability both in assessing new applicants to the order and in determing how best to overcome obstacles. By making a Contested Air Roll against a target within your line of sight, you may learn one of the following pieces of information: their highest or lowest Ring, their highest Skill Rank, or their highest cost Spiritual Advantage or Disadvantage. For every successful Raise made on this roll, you can gain an additional piece of information. You may use this Kiho a number of times per day equal to your Air Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Riding the Clouds</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Air 3</li>
<li>Type: Mystical</li>
</ul>
<p>By aligning his chi with that of the wind, a monk can make his body light and buoyant, dramatically increasing his distance he can leap. While this Kiho is active, you may make a Simple Move action to leap a maximum distance equal to your Air Ring x 10. This effect lasts until you have made such a leap once, then is expended.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soul of the Four Winds</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Air 4</li>
<li>Type: Internal</li>
</ul>
<p>By bringing their chi in alignment with that of the wind, monks may dramatically increase their reaction time and ability to evade the blow of others. While this Kiho is active, your Armor TN is increased by an amount equal to your Insight plus your Air Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stain Upon the Soul</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Air 3 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Martial</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a basic marital technique known to many sects of the Brotherhood, but one that is decried by several orders as impure and wicked. Its ease of use and its terrible effect on others are the reasons most often cited for this. You must make a successful atemi attack against a target. This disrupts the flow of the target's chi and causes crippling pain throughout the body, distracting them from everything else. The target suffers a penalty to all TNs as if he suffered a number of Wound Ranks equal to your Air Ring. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Insight Rank plus your Air Ring. This effect cannot afflict a target multiple times, and is superceded by actual Wounds, not cumulative with them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steal the Air Dragon</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: 7</li>
<li>Type: Kharmic</li>
</ul>
<p>This Kiho borders upon the Mystical, but is not quite as overt as those slivers of enlightenment. By drawing his chi inward, a monk can make himself less noticeable and more prone to being easily overlooked. While this Kiho is active, you gain additional rolled and kept dice equal to your Air Ring on all Stealth Skill Rolls. This effect lasts a number of minutes equal to your Insight Rank.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Way of the Willow</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: 5</li>
<li>Type: Internal</li>
</ul>
<p>The wind is all around us, and by focusing his chi, a monk may see as the wind does, dramatically increasing his ability to perceive threats and preemptively counteract them. While this Kiho is active, if you have not yet taken your Turn during the current combat Round, you may spend a Void Point to immediately interrupt any opponent who declares a melee attack against you. As part of this interruption, you may either make a Move Action away from the opponent, or you may instead make an unarmed attack against them. Once you have done so, the effect of this Kiho ends. This Kiho is rendered inactive if not used within one day of its activation.</p>
<h1 id="toc5"><span>Earth Kiho</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cleansing Spirit</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 4</li>
<li>Type: Internal</li>
</ul>
<p>Rain and time wash the mountains, leaving it free from impurities. While this Kiho is active, you roll a number of additional dice equal to half your Earth Ring (rounded down) on any roll made to resist the effects of poison or disease.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Earthen Fist</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 3</li>
<li>Type: Internal</li>
</ul>
<p>Although part of the elemental fist set of Kiho, this particular technique is more defensive than offensive. While Earthen Fist is active, you may only adopt the Defense or Full Defense Stances. If an opponent makes a melee attack against you and misses, your next Turn you may attempt the Disarm Maneuver against that opponent (assuming they are within range) for no Raises and regardless of the normal restrictions of your stance, ending the Kiho's effect. This Kiho is rendered inactive if not used within one day of its activation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Earth Needs no Eyes</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 3</li>
<li>Type: Internal</li>
</ul>
<p>You can attune yourself to minute vibrations in the earth and use them to detect the movement of others. While this Kiho is active you can detect the approach of any creature or individual that moves across the ground within a distance equal to your Insight Rank x 50 in feet. You only know the location of moving things in contact with the ground. If this Kiho is active when a skirmish begins, you cannot be ambushed or surprised by any land-bound opponent. This effect lasts a number of minutes equal to your Earth Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Embrace the Stone</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 5</li>
<li>Type: Mystical</li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing their chi like that of the mountain, monks may become like stone themselves, turning aside blows and ignoring damage. When you activate this Kiho, you gain a Reduction Rating equal to twice your Earth Ring. This stacks with any other Reduction you have from other sources (such as spells or armor). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Earth Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grasp the Earth Dragon</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 5</li>
<li>Type: Internal</li>
</ul>
<p>Embracing the essence of stone grants a monk incredible powers of resilience. When this Kiho is active, your TN penalties at all Wound Ranks are reduced by an amount equal to your Earth Ring. You may also continue to take Simple Actions when at the Down Wound Rank. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your Earth Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rest, My Brother</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 5 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Martial</li>
</ul>
<p>Easily among the most difficult and most sacred of all Kiho, this technique is restricted to a handful of orders within the Brotherhood. It functions by reversing the chi flow of a Tainted individual, causing them excruciating pain and temporarily restoring clarity of thought. This Kiho requires an atemi attack to be activated. The attack deals normal unarmed damage (despite being an atemi attack), plus an additional number of unkept damage dice equal to the opponent's Shadowlands Taint Rank. If the target is human or other formerly uncorrupted creature (as opposed to an oni or other inherently Tainted creature), he loses all benefits of the Shadowlands Taint for a number of Rounds equal to your Earth Ring. During this time, he is free from the madness and mental instability normally brought on by the Taint.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Root the Mountain</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 5</li>
<li>Type: Internal</li>
</ul>
<p>As the Crab say, the mountain does not move, and neither does one who shares its strength. While this Kiho is active, attempts to use the Knockdown Maneuver against you require 2 extra Raises to be successful. Any attempt to force you to move against your will, including Knockdown Maneuvers, requires a Contested Earth Roll in addition to any other costs or Contested Rolls. You may not make Move Actions without dispelling this effect.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Speed of the Mountains</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 4 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Kharmic</li>
</ul>
<p>Earth is many things, but fleet is not among them. By delivering an atemi attack against an opponent and activating this Kiho, you cause their earthen chi to become ascendant. The opponent's Water Ring is considered to be 2 ranks lower for the purposes of determining how far they can move as part of a Move Action. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to twice your Earth Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Way of the Earth</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 4</li>
<li>Type: Martial</li>
</ul>
<p>The grip of a monk can be like stone, crushing those who find themselves trapped in his grasp. Opponents engaged in a Grapple with you while this Kiho is active suffer a number of additional Wounds per Round equal to your Earth Ring, regardless of who is winning the Grapple. This damage is inflicted during the Reactions Stage. This effect lasts a number of minutes equal to your Earth Ring.</p>
<h1 id="toc6"><span>Fire Kiho</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Body is an Anvil</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 4</li>
<li>Type: Mystical</li>
</ul>
<p>A master of the ways of Fire can channel his chi outward, granting him a measure of protection and repelling attackers. While this Kiho is active, your skin becomes extremely hot to the touch, and anyone who touches you, including those who target you with unarmed attacks or those you strike with an unarmed attack, suffer Wounds equal to your Fire Ring. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to twice your Fire Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breaking Blow</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 3</li>
<li>Type: Martial</li>
</ul>
<p>Fire destroys all it touches, and a monk harnessing his Fire chi can achieve similar effects. While this Kiho is active, your unarmed strikes inflicts full damage to all non-metal substances, including wood and stone, without inflicting any ill effects on you as a result of punching such objects. This effect lasts a number of minutes equal to your Fire Ring. The Game Master is the ultimate judge of how much damage a particular inanimate object can withstand before being destroyed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Channel the Fire Dragon</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 6</li>
<li>Type: Internal</li>
</ul>
<p>Fire cannot be extinguished by more fire, nor can it be quelled with cold. While this Kiho is active, any damage you suffer as a result of heat or cold is reduced by -2k2. This includes effects that generate fire, such as spells and other Kiho. This effect lasts for one day.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dance of the Flames</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 6</li>
<li>Type: Martial</li>
</ul>
<p>Filling one's chi with the power of Fire has considerable effects on one's speed as well as one's temperament. While this Kiho is in effect, you may make unarmed attacks as a Simple Action rather than a Complex Action. You must make an unarmed attack against an opponent (rather than an ally or inanimate object) every Round while this Kiho is active, or its effects end immediately.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Destiny's Strike</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 4</li>
<li>Type: Martial</li>
</ul>
<p>The force of destiny is powerful, and can be harnessed by those who truly understand their place in the universe. While this Kiho is active, whenever you are struck by a melee attack from an opponent, you may immediately make a counterattack in the form of a single unarmed attack. If you have not taken your Turn yet this round, this counts as your Turn. If you have taken your Turn, this is a Free Action instead. This counterattack ignores any Wound Penalties suffered as a result of the attack to which it is responding. This Kiho lasts until the end of the skirmish.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Falling Star Strike</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 7 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Martial</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most blatant and powerful of all Kiho, the Falling Star Strike is a devastating martial attack that can cripple opponents permanently if not used with restraint. When employed, the fists of the monk using it are wreathed in flame, and his eyes burn like fiery embers. This Kiho may only be activated by spending a Void Point, and may not be activated by making a Void / Meditation Skill Roll. It also requires two Raises on an unarmed attack to activate. The unarmed attack inflicts normal damage, plus an additional amount of damage with a DR equal to your Fire Ring in rolled and kept dice. Additionally, you and the target must make a Contested Fire Roll. If you are successful, the target is struck Blind for a number of hours equal to your Fire Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fire's Fleeting Speed</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 4</li>
<li>Type: Kharmic</li>
</ul>
<p>Fire darts and surges, as do those who carry it in their souls. While this Kiho is active, increase the distance you may move when using any Move Action by +5'. This effect lasts a number of Rounds equal to your Fire Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flame Fist</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 3 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Martial</li>
</ul>
<p>By mingling your chi with another's while Fire is ascendant within your body, you can disorient and confuse an opponent, inhibiting their actions. An opponent struck by this Kiho's activating atemi strike suffers a TN penalty to all actions equal to three times your Fire Ring. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your Fire Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unbalance the Mind</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 5 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Mystical</li>
</ul>
<p>A momentary disruption of the Fire chi within a target can leave them addled and confused. The target of this Kiho's activating atemi strike is Dazed.</p>
<h1 id="toc7"><span>Water Kiho</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As the Breakers</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 4 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Kharmic</li>
</ul>
<p>By disrupting the flow of chi through others, you can inhibit them without harm. With a successful atemi strike, the target of your strike loses one Simple Action this Round. You may only target opponents who have not yet acted in the present Round, and an opponent may not be affected by this Kiho more than once per skirmish.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buoyed by the Kami</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 3</li>
<li>Type: Mystical</li>
</ul>
<p>A monk whose Water chi is ascendant can resist the siren call of the depths. While this Kiho is active, you may move across the surface of water as if it were basic terrain. This effect only continues as long as you are taking Simple Move Actions each round, and lasts for a maximum of five minutes, at which time you may reactivate this Kiho if necessary.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chi Protection</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 4 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Martial</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the strangest application of the atemi technique, this Kiho permits a monk to restore or enhance the flow of chi through another's body, hastening the healing of wounds or other ailments. You must spend a Void Point to activate this Kiho (as opposed to the normal allowance to activate by Void / Meditation Skill Roll), which is done immediately after successfully striking a target (either an opponent or willing ally) with an atemi strike. The individual targeted by the strike regains a number of Wounds equal to your Water Ring, immediately and then at the start of every Turn subsequent Round for a number of Rounds equal to your Insight Rank. You may not use this Kiho on yourself.</p>
<p>__Freezing the Lifeblood_</p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 7 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Martial</li>
</ul>
<p>This attack disrupts the flow of chi through an opponent's body, paralyzing them for a short time. The individual struck by the atemi attack is paralyzed, effectively Stunned and unable to take Move Actions, and may not move under his own power for a number of Rounds equal to your Insight rank.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Partaking the Waters</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 6</li>
<li>Type: Internal</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain monks may channel the power of the ocean into their bodies, moving and flowing away from attacks like the sea itself. While this Kiho is active, you gain Reduction equal to your Water Ring. This stacks with Reduction from other sources such as spells and armor. This effect lasts a number of Rounds equal to twice your Water Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ride the Water Dragon</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 3</li>
<li>Type: Kharmic</li>
</ul>
<p>To walk with the Water Dragon's power is to harness the incredible restorative abilities of the ocean. While this Kiho is active, for a number of Rounds equal to your Insight Rank, you recover Wounds equal to your Water Ring during the Reactions Stage of the Round</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Slap the Wave</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 7</li>
<li>Type: Mystical</li>
</ul>
<p>A powerful expression of inner strength, this Kiho channels the monk's chi outward in an explosive wave that carries the power of a tsunami. You must spend a Void Point to activate this Kiho (Void/Meditation Skill Rolls are not possible). You must strike your hands together and release a powerful kiai shout. Everyone in your forward facing arc and within a distance of your Water Ring x 5 feet must succeed at a Contested Water Roll against you, or become Dazed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Waves in All Things</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 4</li>
<li>Type: Mystical</li>
</ul>
<p>Water flows through all things, including the earth. You may make an unarmed attack by striking at a body of standing water or the earth. The effects of this strike are felt by one opponent who is in contact with either the water or earth (whichever one was struck) and who is within a number of feet equal to your Water Ring x 10. The effect of the strike is quite obvious, and may not be performed discreetly. If you are concealed at the time this Kiho is activated, your position is immediately revealed to the target and those in his immediate vicinity.</p>
<h1 id="toc8"><span>Void Kiho</span></h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Banish All Shadows</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 4 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Kharmic</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most powerful effects of one's chi upon another is the clarity it brings, which can allow one to overcome shortcomings for a short time. The target of this Kiho's activating strike may, for a number of Rounds equal to your Void Ring, ignore the effects of his highest-point Disadvantage. This effect does not target Spiritual or Social Disadvantages.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Death Touch</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 7 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Mystical</li>
</ul>
<p>The death touch, also known as dim mak, is perhaps the rarest and most reviled use of a monk's understanding of the flow of chi. It involves a series of atemi strikes that disrupt and corrupt the flow of chi through an opponent's body, leading to debilitating pain and possibly death. You must successfully strike an opponent with three atemi strikes on three consecutive Rounds immediately after activating this Kiho, and must spend an additional Void Point after the third and final strike (in addition to any Void Points spent to activate the Kiho). You opponent suffers increasing weakness broken up by bouts of agonizing pain. All of the target's Rings are reduced by 1 each hour. The maximum penalty is an amount equal to your Insight Rank. If any Ring reaches 0 due to these penalties, the target falls into a catatonic state and must make three Contested Void Rolls against you (these rolls use the target's full Void, without penalties). If the target loses all three rolls by at least 5 or more, he dies. (This Kiho does not automatically kill the victim if his Earth is reduced to 0.) Use of this technique can be grounds for excommunication from the Brotherhood of Shinsei.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eight Directions Awareness</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 5</li>
<li>Type: Mystical</li>
</ul>
<p>Some monks are at a state of harmony with the world to such extent that they are aware of everything around them. While this Kiho is active, you become aware of all living things within a distance equal to your Void Ring x 10 feet. You are also aware of any object or individual within that range that has been deliberately concealed, including secret doors, hidden compartments, buried objects, etc.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Silent Solace</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 5 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Kharmic</li>
</ul>
<p>Proper use of nerve strikes can impede not only the physical, but the spiritual as well. An opponent struck by this Kiho's activating strike must expend two spell slots to cast a single spell. This effect lasts a number of Rounds equal to your Void Ring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Song of the World</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 3</li>
<li>Type: Kharmic</li>
</ul>
<p>By listening to the song of the elements around him, a monk may perceive the universe slightly ahead of all others. You must target an opponent within 50 feet when activating this Kiho, and succeed at a Contested Void Roll against him. If successful, his Initiative Score is reduced by 5 and yours in increased by the same amount.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spin the Kharmic Wheel</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 8 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Kharmic</li>
</ul>
<p>Theoretically one of the most powerful Kiho known to exist, Spin the Kharmic Wheel is known only to a handful of reclusive masters within the Brotherhood, and discovered by a new soul perhaps once in a generation. You must deliver this Kiho via an unarmed attack in order to properly harness the forces of destiny that it unleashes. You expend all remaining Void Points when this Kiho is activated. The target of your attack loses one randomly determined Social, Spiritual, or Mental Disadvantage and gains a new randomly determined Social, Spiritual, or Mental Disadvantage of equal value. The GM may opt to choose the Disadvantage instead of selecting randomly, if that seems to produce a more interesting (or believable) result.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Touch the Void Dragon</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 4</li>
<li>Type: Internal</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain orders of the Brotherhood are adept at aligning their chi with the dominant Element in the environment around them, drawing strength from the world. While this Kiho is active, one of your Rings and its associated Traits are considered one Rank higher. Which Ring is affected depends upon the environment. Mountains increase Earth, the seashore increases Water, the plains increases Air, the desert or volcanic areas increase Fire, etc.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To the Last Breath</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 3</li>
<li>Type: Kharmic</li>
</ul>
<p>With a simple exhalation, a monk can expend his energy to the universe around him, allowing others to partake of it as they wish. Any one selected individual within 20 feet when the Kiho is activated gains a Void Point on their next Turn. No target may benefit from this Kiho more than twice per day.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Void Fist</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 4 (Atemi)</li>
<li>Type: Martial</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike other atemi attacks, the Void Fist is a normal unarmed strike that would appear, if observed, to be damaging to its target. This is an illusion, however, as the true purpose is to use the target as a conduit with the great Void. You must make a successful Raise to strike an opponent with Void Fist. A successful strike inflicts no damage, but you immediately regain 2 Void Points. This Kiho can only be used on enemies, and has no effect on allies. It has no effect on targets who do not have Void Points.</p>
