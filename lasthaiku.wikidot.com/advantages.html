<p><strong>Absolute Direction [Mental] (1 Point) [CR]</strong><br />
You possess an almost supernatural sense of direction, and you always know what direction is north, no matter the circumstances. This ability does not function if you are more than one day's travel inside the Shadowlands.</p>
<p><strong>Allies [Social] (Variable Cost) [CR]</strong><br />
You have carefully nurtured social connections. Some of those in your web of connections would go to great lengths to protect you, while others have considerable resources. And some precious few are both. The total cost of this Advantage is determined by how many points you spend on your all's degree of influence and their devotion to you. Crane characters may purchase this Advantage for 1 point less than its normal cost.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Influence</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1 Pt. - Minor (no land or appointments)</li>
<li>2 Pts. - Moderate (some land or political influence)</li>
<li>4 Pts. - Major (vast lands or prestigious appointments)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Devotion</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1 Pt. - Your ally would go out of his way to help you, but not risk his honor</li>
<li>2 Pts. - Your ally would risk his honor to help you, but would so secretly</li>
<li>4 Pts. - Your ally would do anything to aid you, regardless of the cost</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balance [Mental] (2 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You possess an inherent calm and serenity that others have difficulty overcoming when attempting to antagonize or taunt you, and that strengthens you when your honor is tested. When adding your Honor Rank to the total of any roll made to resist Intimidation, Temptation, you add an additional +1k0 to the roll as well.</p>
<p><strong>Blackmail [Social] (Variable) [CR]</strong><br />
You possess knowlege and proof of a dark secret held by another, and can use that secret to elicit their cooperation in a number of ways. The cost of the Advantage is equal to the Status Rank of the individual whom you are blackmailing. Using this Advantage too frequently or making grandiose demands on the person in question may result in deciding your death is worth the risk of exposing their secret, no matter what the consequences might be. Scorpion characters may purchase this Advantage for 1 point less than its normal cost.</p>
<p><strong>Bland [Physical] (2 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You are extremely unremarkable in every regard, and others have a difficult time recognizing you unless you deliberately draw attention to your identity or affiliations. Whenever someone is making a Lore: Bushido / Awareness roll to determine your Honor Rank, or a Lore: Heraldry / Intelligence roll to determine your identity (based on your Glory Rank), you may voluntarily choose to increase the TN of that roll by 10.</p>
<p><strong>Blissful Betrothal [Social] (3 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
Your marriage has been arranged and, much to your delight, you have come to truly love your intended spouse. The social connections you have established as part of your enthusiastic marriage preparations allow you to purchase the following Advantages for two points less each (to a minimum of 1 point): Gentry, Kharmetic Tie (with your betrothed only), Social Position, and Wealth.</p>
<p><strong>Blood of Osano-Wo [Spiritual] (4 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You are descended from a bloodline of Hida Osano-Wo, the Fortune of Fire and Thunder, and his resilience lives on in you. You are immune to any penalties or damage from natural weather conditions, such as winter cold, summer heat, etc. If you suffer damage from a spell that employs natural forces (such as a mighty storm created by Hurricane, or a lightning bolt summoned by Fury of Osano-Wo), reduce the amount of damage you suffer by 1k1. Crab and Mantis characters may purchase this Advantage for 3 points.</p>
<p><strong>Chosen by the Oracles [Spiritual] (6 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
For reasons beyond your understanding, you have caught the notice of one of the Oracles, humans suffused with the divine power of the Elemental Dragons. You must select one Ring when you take this Advantage. You gain a bonus of +1k1 to the total of all Ring Rolls using that Ring.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Thinker [Mental] (3 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You possess a sharp mind and keen powers of perception, making it very difficult for others to deceive you. Whenever you make a Contested Roll against someone who is attempting to confuse or manipulate you in any way, you gain a bonus of +1k0 to the total of your roll. Dragon characters may purchase this Advantage for 2 points.</p>
<p><strong>Crab Hands [Physical] (3 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You possess a natural affinity for weapons of all kinds, and can take up even an unfamiliar blade without difficulty in times of stress. Any time that you would be forced to make an Unskilled Roll when using a Weapon Skill, you are instead considered to have 1 rank in that Weapon Skill. Crab and bushi characters may purchase this Advantage for 2 points.</p>
<p><strong>Crafty [Mental] (3 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You have a knack for instinctively knowing how to do things that most people prefer to avoid at all costs. Whenever you are in a situation where you would be forced to make an Unskilled Roll using a Low Skill, you are considered to have 1 rank in the Skill instead. Scorpion, Spider, and Ninja characters may purchase this Advantage for 2 points.</p>
<p><strong>Dangerous Beauty [Physical] (3 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You possess a certain quality that makes you all but irresistible to members of the opposite sex, and they succumb easily to your manipulations. You gain a bonus of +1k0 to the total of all Temptation Skill Rolls made with members of the opposite sex. Scorpion characters may purchase this Advantage for 2 points.</p>
<p><strong>Daredevil [Mental] (3 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You have a natural flair for athleticism and a complete lack of self-preservation when it comes to physical damage. Whenever you spend a Void Point to enhance an Athletics Skill Roll, you gain a bonus of +3k1 to the total of the roll instead of the normal +1k1. Mantis characters may purchase this Advantage for 2 points.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Paragon [Mental] (5 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You have mastered one of the precepts of Shourido, the dark code that forms the antithesis of Bushido. Once per session, you may voluntarily sacrifice 5 points of Honor as a Free Action in order to affect a particular type of roll as indicated below, and gain a bonus of +5 to the total of that roll. If you do not have 5 points of Honor to spend in this manner, you may spend a Void Point instead. Spider Characters may purchase this Advantage for 4 Points. The type of roll that each precept of Shourido affects is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control: Re-roll any Social Skill Roll</li>
<li>Determination: Negate all TN/Wound penalties on one Skill or Spell Casting roll (no +5 bonus is applied to the roll)</li>
<li>Insight: Re-roll any roll that used the Awareness Trait</li>
<li>Knowledge: Re-roll any roll that used the Intelligence Trait</li>
<li>Perfection: Spending the Honor causes any one die of your choice on a Skill Roll to explode (no +5 bonus added)</li>
<li>Strength: Re-roll any damage Roll</li>
<li>Will: Spending the Honor negates 10 Wounds at the moment they are suffered</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Darling of the Court [Social] (2 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
During a recent court session, you did something that gained the notice of the host, resulting in an instant increase in your importance with all those in attendance. Select one court, such as the court of Kyuden Bayushi, the court of the Okura district in Toshi Ranbo, etc. When in attendance at this court, your Status is effectively one rank higher, but only while court is in session. Courtier characters may purchase this Advantage for 1 Point. You may take this Advantage multiple times for different courts, but only once for each particular court.</p>
<p><strong>Different School [Social] (5 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
Your family sacrificed considerable resources and favors in order to sponsor your entrance into the School of another Clan. When creating your character, you may select a School of a different Clan to attend. You are still a member of your own Clan, however, creating a potential conflict between your loyalty to your sensei and your loyalty to your lord and family.</p>
<p><strong>Elemental Blessing [Spiritual] (4 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You are much beloved by the kami of a particular element, although you know not why that might be. As a result, the cost of increasing the Traits associated with one particular Ring, chosen when this Advantage is purchased, is decreased by 1. For example, if you choose Earth when you purchase this Advantage, the cost of increasing Stamina and Willpower is reduced by 1 Experience Point every time you increase them. Void may not be chosen for this Advantage. Phoenix characters may purchase this Advantage for 3 points.</p>
<p><strong>Enlightened [Spiritual] (6 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
Your spiritual journey toward complete harmony with the universe as a whole has begun to reach its destination. In addition to whatever storyline effects your GM may choose to bestow on you, you also find it easier to enhance your connection to the Void. When you are using Experience Points to increase your Void Ring, the total cost is decreased by 2 points each time. Dragon and monk characters may purchase this Advantage for 5 points.</p>
<p><strong>Fame [Social] (3 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
As a result of your actions, there are many in the Empire who know your name. You gain +1 Glory Rank.</p>
<p><strong>Forbidden Knowledge [Mental] (5 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
There is a subject about which you possess considerable knowledge and insight. The problem is that his subject is forbidden, and considered grossly socially inappropriate if not outright illegal. Anyone who discovers your expertise in this area might rightly wonder how you came upon it. The benefits of the Advantage vary depending upon the nature of the information, and players should discuss with their GM how this Advantage will work. The most common examples of Forbidden Knowledge include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaijin Pepper: You possess firsthand knowledge of gunpowder, both how to create it and how to use it. You gain one rank in Craft: Explosives, and possess a small pouch of gaijin pepper that you may carry with you if you so choose.</li>
<li>Gozoku: You possess an intricate knowledge of the Gozoku onspiracy against the throne, either in its first or second incarnation, and may in fact be a member of that organization. You gain one rank in Lore: Gozoku and gain a bonus on +1k1 on Social Skill rolls with known members of the Gozoku.</li>
<li>Kolat: You are intimately familiar with the nature and operations of the blasphemous Kolat order, and may be a member of that organization. You gain one rank in Lore: Kolat and gain a bonus of +1k1 on Social Skill rolls with known members of the Kolat.</li>
<li>Lying Darkness: You are familiar with the entity known as the Lying Darkness, its methods, and its minions. You may have come into conflict with it in the past, and perhaps it hunts you still. You gain one rank of Lore: Lying Darkness, and you may observe an individual and make a Lore: Lying Darkness / Perception Roll (TN 30) to determine if he has been corrupted by the Lying Darkness.</li>
<li>Maho: You are familiar with the forbidden and blasphemous magic known as maho, and may in fact be a practicing maho-tsukai (black sorcerer) yourself. You gain 1 rank in Lore: Maho and, at the GM's discretion, you might begin play knowing a maho spell.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Friendly Kami [Spiritual] (5 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
A particular kami has befriended you, and stays in your vicinity at all times. Choose one element when this Advantage is purchased. You gain a bonus of +1k1 to the total of all Spell Casting Rolls made to cast Sense, Commune, or Summon with regard to that Element only. Only shugenja may purchase this Advantage. You may not select this Advantage for an Element in which you are Deficient.</p>
<p><strong>Friend of the Brotherhood [Spiritual] (5 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You have studied among your allies at the Brotherhood of Shinsei, and as a result you understand your place in the universe slightly better than most. You may purchase Kiho as though you are a monk of the Brotherhood of Shinsei, instead of paying a higher cost. You must still meet all other normal restrictions on learning Kiho. Only characters from Monk or Shugenja Schools (and not Monk characters from Brotherhood of Shinsei) may purchase this Advantage. Dragon characters may purchase this Advantage for 4 points.</p>
<p><strong>Friend of the Elements [Spiritual] (4 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
The spirits of a certain Element swirl about you at all times, lending their aid when possible even though you are likely unaware of their presence. Choose a Ring when this Advantage is purchased. Whenever you make a Trait Roll with either Trait associated with that Ring, you gain a Free Raise. Shugenja characters may purchase this Advantage for 3 points.</p>
<p><strong>Gaijin Gear [Material] (5 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You possess a single piece of equipment that is gaijin in origin, constructed somewhere beyond the boundaries of the Emerald Empire. It may be a weapon from one of the many warrior cultures around Rokugan, such as the Senpet Empire, the overseas kingdoms of Merenae and Thrane, the barbarian Yobanjin tribes to the north, or even the distant Yodotai Empire far to the northwest. In this case simply establish a comparable weapon from Rokugan and use its mechanics, but the item will require its own unique Weapon Skill to utilize it. Non-weapon options include such bizarre objects as compasses, spyglasses, magnifying glasses, scissors, etc. Mantis and Unicorn characters may purchase this Advantage for 4 points.</p>
<p><strong>Gentry [Material] (Variable) [CR]</strong><br />
In the manner of all samurai, you have been given a duty to oversee that which ultimately belongs to the Emperor. In your case, however you charge is significantly larger than most ever achieve. The number of points assigned to this Advantage determines the size of the holding you have been assigned to oversee. Multiple characters can combine points in this Advantage in order to jointly oversee a larger holding. Characters assigned to oversee a holding are responsible for defending it, administrating it, and ensuring that all taxes are paid to all responsible parties. This can be the basis for an entire campaign.</p>
<p>Holding (Cost)</p>
<ul>
<li>Village (8 points)</li>
<li>Large Village (15 Points)</li>
<li>Unique Holding [Sake Works, Falconry, etc.] (18 points)</li>
<li>Town (20 points)</li>
<li>City (25 points)</li>
<li>Province (30 points)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Great Destiny [Spiritual] (5 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
The kharmic cycle has some great purpose in store for you, and the Celestial Order will conspire to keep you alive, no matter what, until your destiny can be fulfilled. Once per session, when you suffer Wounds that would kill you, you are reduced to a single Wound remaining instead. This will only happen once per session, as there are limits to the extent that the heavens will intervene in mortal affairs.</p>
<p><strong>Great Potential [Varies] (5 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
Within you lies the potential to excel at one particular endeavor, perhaps more so than any other living soul in the Empire. Select any one Skill when you purchase this Advantage. When you make Raises on a Skill Roll using that Skill, your Raises are limited to your rank in that Skill instead of your Void Ring. If your Void Ring is higher, however, you may use that as a measure for your Raises if you so choose.</p>
<p><strong>Hands of Stone [Physical] (6 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
Some have a natural talent for unarmed combat, and you are one such individual. The Damage Rolls for your unarmed attacks are increased by +0k1. Monk characters may purchase this Advantage for 5 points.</p>
<p><strong>Heart of Vengeance [Social] (5 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
One Clan has earned your eternal, undying hatred, and nothing will ever quench your rage. Select one Clan or other faction (such as the Brotherhood of Shinsei or one of the Imperial families) when purchasing this Advantage. You gain a bonus of +1k1 to the total of any Contested Roll made against a member of that Clan/faction. Spider characters may purchase this Advantage for 4 points.</p>
<p><strong>Heartless [Mental] (4 Points)</strong><br />
You have a heart of stone. Attempts to woo you or sway your heart - whether through love, courtesy, compassion, or mercy - fall on deaf ears. You gain a +1k0 bonus to rolls made to resist any Courtier, Sincerity, or Temptation roll made for the purpose of persuading you, seducing your, or otherwise changing your mind.</p>
<p><strong>Hero of the People [Social] (2 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
Although your reputation among your fellow samurai may not be any better than that of the next individual, your actions have garnered the adoration of the common folk. When meeting citizens of Rokugan who are not members of the samurai caste, the TN for them to recognize you, as determined by your Glory Rank, is lowered by 10.</p>
<p><strong>Higher Purpose [Mental] (3 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
There is some greater purpose to which you have devoted your life. This is not a simple matter, but some grand work that will take years or perhaps even the whole of your life to accomplish. Whatever this goal is, during any session in which you and the GM agree you have made demonstrable progress toward it, you gain one additional Experience Point.</p>
<p><strong>Imperial Scribe [Social] (4 Points) [IH]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements; Status 2+, Calligraphy 4+</li>
</ul>
<p>You have been trained as a scribe in the Imperial City, which is both a recognition of your considerable skill at calligraphy and means of ensuring that you remain among the most respected calligraphers hereafter. You gain a bonus of +1k0 on all Social skill Rolls made against shugenja and artisans, who have a great appreciation for your skill and position. Additionally, you gain a Free Raise on Calligraphy Skill Rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Imperial Spouse [Social] (5 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
Through a careful exchange of favors and resources, your family arranged for you to be married to a minor member of an Imperial family. Your spouse was not of high enough station to warrant you taking an Imperial name, but there are benefits all the same. You gain +0.5 Status Ranks, and gain a bonus of +1k1 to the total of all Social Skill rolls made with members of the Imperial families.</p>
<p><strong>Inari's Blessing [Spiritual] (3 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
The Fortune of Rice is a lesser Fortune, but nevertheless is among the most revered entities throughout the whole of Rokugan, particularly by the common people of the Empire. When fasting or deprived of food, you do not suffer from the normal inability to regain Void Points, although other penalties apply as normal.</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance [Material] (5 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
When you received your gempukku ceremony, your family honored you with an heirloom of your ancestors. It is among your most precious possessions, and you would die before you allowed it to be harmed or brought dishonor to it. You possess one item in addition to the normal starting equipment provided by your School. Whenever you make a Skill Roll using this item, such as a Perform: Biwa roll with a biwa, a Games: Go roll with a go set, or a Kenjutsu roll with a katana, you gain a bonus of +1k1 to the roll. This bonus does not apply to any attack or damage rolls, only Skill Rolls made for non-combat purposes (rolls made outside of a skirmish).<br />
Players and GMs may agree to allow a more powerful or unique item to inherited for a higher Experience Point cost. Such special cases should be discussed carefully beforehand to ensure fairness and balance.</p>
<p><strong>Inner Gift [Spiritual] (7 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You possess a mysterious gift that even shugenja cannot fully understand. Monks describe individuals such as yourself as existing in an unique state of harmony with the universe, but then they say that sort of thign a lot. Your gift may be a manifestation of the kami, perhaps an indicator of spirit ancestry, or any of a number of different theories. The exact nature of an Inner Gift should be discussed with the GM before taking this Advantage. Examples of Inner Gifts include the following:</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<td>Gift</td>
<td>Effect</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Animal Ken</td>
<td>You may instinctively Sense the mood of animals; animals regard you as friendly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Empathy</td>
<td>You gain a bonus of +1k1 to Courtier rolls made to determine another's feelings/desires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Foresight</td>
<td>You are difficult to surprise, and gain a bonus of +1k0 to the total of Initiative rolls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lesser Prophecy</td>
<td>You sometimes have vague dreams of the future, such as a bloody knife before a murder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Spirit Touch</td>
<td>You may make an Awareness roll (TN 15) to see the last person to touch an object you are touching.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><strong>Irreproachable [Mental] (2 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You have a soul of virtue that is beyond reproach, and others find it difficult if not impossible to lead you into dishonorable behavior. When making a Contested Roll where the other party is using the Temptation Skill, you gain a bonus of +1k0 to your roll. Imperial characters may purchase this Advantage for 1 point.</p>
<p><strong>Ishiken-Do [Spiritual] (8 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You have that rarest of gifts, the ability to commune with the Void itself. This gift is similiar in many respects to the ability to speak to the kami, save that there are no naturally occurring kami of the Void; the Void itself is a living thing, both everything and nothing at all once. You may cast Void spells. Only shugenja may take this Advantage, and without this Advantage a character cannot cast Void spells. Phoenix characters may purchase this Advantage for 6 points.</p>
<p><strong>Kharmic Tie [Spiritual] (1-5 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
Your destiny is not yours alone, but is bonded to that of another in some fundamental way. You may have been close to this other person during a previous life, or perhaps your destiny in this life will yet be entwined in theirs in some essential manner. Select one person when purchasing this Advantage. For each point spent on this Advantage, once per session you gain a bonus of +1k1 to the total of all attack rolls made when fighting for or protecting the person to whom you are bonded.</p>
<p><strong>Languages [Mental] (1 or 3 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
The Empire has only one language with two dialects. The world around Rokugan, however, has a wide variety of nations and cultures, each with their own language. For 1 point, you may learn one human language from any surrounding culture, including but not limited to: the Yobanjin dialect, Senpet, Yodotai, Mekham, Merenae, Rhuumal, Thrane, etc. A non-human language, such as the Nezumi or Naga languages, requires three points and confers only the ability to understand the language and a limited ability to express very basic concepts verbally.</p>
<p><strong>Large [Physical] (4 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You are significantly larger than the average Rokugani, ranging in height from 6'0&quot; to 6'3&quot; in height. You fain a bonus of +1k0 to the total of all Damage Rolls for any large melee weapon. Crab characters may purchase this Advantage for 3 points.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership [Social] (6 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You have an innate knack for leading and inspiring others in battle. Once per Round during the Reactions stage, you may add your School Rank plus 1k1 to the Initiative Score of one ally in a skirmish. This bonus lasts until the Reactions stage of the following round. An individual may only benefit from one use of this Advantage per Round. Lion characters may purchase this Advantage for 5 points.</p>
<p><strong>Luck [Spiritual] (3/6/9 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
Fortune favors the mortal man. A number of times per session equal to your rank in this Advantage, you may choose to immediately re-roll any one roll you make, keeping the higher of the two results.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Resistance [Spiritual] (2/4/6 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
For reasons beyond your understanding, the kami are reluctant to involve themselves with you in any way. For each rank you possess in this Advantage, all elemental spells targeting you have the TN of the Spell Casting Roll made to enact it increased by +3. Maho, gaijin, and non-human forms of magic are not affected by this Advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Schools [Social] (10 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You have been given an incredible opportunity to study at multiple dojo, each associated with a different major School. This is a rare opportunity indeed, as being released from one's oaths to one sensei in order to study with another requires extraordinary circumstances. This Advantage may only be purchased during play, and once it is taken, the character stops progression in his current School. Upon reaching the next Insight Rank, he begins learning Techniques from the new School beginning at Rank 1. Before learning any Techniques from a given School, you must possess at least one rank in all School Skills taught there. Under no circumstances can a character ever take ranks in both a Bushi School and a Shugenja School; the two are simply incompatible in every respect.</p>
<p><strong>Naishou Citizen (3 Points) [NP]</strong><br />
You are an inhabitant of Naishou Province, a proud and ancient area which has remained dedicated to the worship of the Fortunes through difficult times. You can buy a Seven Fortunes’ Blessing Advantage for one less Experience Point. With the GM’s agreement, you can later buy the Advantage again for a different Fortune, although you lose the original Advantage when doing so. Finally, you gain a Free Raise on all Social Skill rolls dealing with monks aligned to the Fortune for which you currently have the Seven Fortunes’ Blessing Advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Paragon [Mental] (7 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You exemplify the code of Bushido, and have taken one particular tenet to heart and made it your way of life. In addition to the benefit listed below, any time you gain Honor for exhibiting the virtue for which you have the Paragon Advantage, you gain an additional +1 Honor. Lion characters may purchase this Advantage for 6 points.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compassion - Any time you spend a Void Point to improve a roll made to directly help those lower than you in the Celestial Order, you gain +2k2 instead of +1k1.</li>
<li>Courage - You gain a bonus of +1k1 to the total of any roll made to resist Intimidation or to overcome Fear effects.</li>
<li>Courtesy - Any time you make an Etiquette roll to avoid an embarrassment or breach of honor, you add +2k0 to the roll.</li>
<li>Duty - You may spend a Void Point on any Skill Roll or Spell Casting Roll to negate all TN penalties for that roll, including Wound penalties.</li>
<li>Honesty - On a Sincerity (Honesty) roll, you add a bonus of +1k1. You may add this bonus even if you do not possess the Emphasis, but it would apply in the situation at hand.</li>
<li>Honor - You may add twice your Honor Rank to all rolls to resist Temptation or Intimidation rolls, instead of the normal bonus.</li>
<li>Sincerity - You may add a bonus of +2k0 to all Contested Rolls using Sincerity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Perceived Honor [Social] (3 Points/Rank) [CR]</strong><br />
Others find it difficult to perceive your true nature, a fact that benefits you in concealing your sometimes questionable actions. For each rank you possess in this Advantage, your Honor is considered one full rank higher for the purpose of all attempts to discern it. Anyone attempting to roll Lore: Bushido / Awareness to determine your Honor Rank will determine the false rank instead of the actual Honor.</p>
<p><strong>Precise Memory [Mental] (3 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You have an incredible ability to recall exactly things you have seen or heard. In any situation where you need to remember something exactly the way it was, whether the wording of something you read or the details of a person's physical appearance, you add a bonus of +1k1 to your Intelligence Trait Roll.</p>
<p><strong>Prodigy [Physical] (12 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You are a marvel of the dojo, and your sensei believe that you will accomplish incredible things in your lifetime. Whenever you make a School Skill Roll, you gain a bonus of +1k0 to the roll.</p>
<p><strong>Quick [Physical] (6 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
You can react quickly to others, seizing advantage where previously there had been none. If you did not act first during a Combat Round, during the Reactions Stage of combat you may add your Reflexes Trait to the total of your Initiative Score for all subsequent rounds of this skirmish. This may be done each Round that you did not act first. Ninja characters may purchase this Advantage for 5 points.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Healer [Physical] (3 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
Your body mends incredibly quickly, allowing you to recover from even devastating wounds with amazing speed. For the purposes of recovering Wounds, your Stamina is considered to be two ranks higher.</p>
<p><strong>Read Lips [Mental] (4 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
Either through natural ability or incredible patience and practice, you have the ability to understand what others are saying even if you cannot hear them, simply by observing how their lips move. When you are in a situation where others are speaking and you cannot hear them, you can understand what they are saying by making a Perception Trait Roll against TN 15 + 5 for every twenty feet away from you the speakers are. Courtier characters may purchase this Advantage for 3 points.</p>
<p><strong>Sacred Weapon [Material] (Varies) [CR]</strong><br />
You possess a special weapon created by the master weaponsmiths of your Clan, and considered to be an icon of all who bear the mon of your Clan. The cost of each individual weapon is denoted by the number after its name.</p>

<p><strong>Sancrosanct [Social] (4 Points) [CR]</strong><br />
Because of some great service you or perhaps your parents performed on behalf of the Emperor, the Son of Heaven has placed you under his protection. You may not purchase this Advantage unless you possess an Honor Rank of 6.0 or higher. So long as your Honor does not drop below 6.0, no one of Honor Rank 5 or higher may attack you unless you attack them first; their rigid code of honor simply will not allow them to blatantly go against the Emperor's wishes.

A servant has been assigned to assist you by your family, or possibly one whose help you purchased with your own resources in order to make life a little bit easier. You may have a maximum number of servants equal to twice your Status Rank. Different kinds of servants have different useful abilities and can more easily be supplied by different Clans. Typically, a servant has all Traits at rank 2 and a single Skill at rank 3. You may add additional Skill Ranks or Emphases to a servant at the time the Advantage is purchased by paying 3 additional points per Skill Rank or Emphasis.
