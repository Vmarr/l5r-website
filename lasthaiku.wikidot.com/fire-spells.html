<h1 id="toc0"><span>Mastery Level 1</span></h1>
<p><strong>Biting Steel [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 1 (Craft)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 bladed weapon</li>
<li>Duration: 1 minute</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 minute)</li>
</ul>
<p>Fire spirits can infuse metal with their own fury, turning a sharp edge into a supremely perfect one. This spell enhances the damage of steel bladed weapons, such as swords, knives, naginata, etc. Biting Steel cannot affect weapons which are not metal blades, which are nemuranai, or which have already been enhanced by magical effects. The weapon's DR is increased by 1k1 for the duration of the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Burning Kiss of Steel [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 1 (Battle)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: One melee weapon in caster's hand</li>
<li>Duration: 5 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+2 minutes)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell embraces a weapon with fire, causing it to be larger and more effective. When the spell is cast, a tendril of fire extends from your hands to engulf your weapon. (If you drop or lose the weapon, the spell effect ends.) This weapon gains a +1k1 bonus to melee attack rolls. The bonus is +2k2 when making attacks against mounted opponents or opponents of larger than human size.</p>
<p><strong>Envious Flames [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 1</li>
<li>Range: 30'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>Fire's most basic power is destruction, and summoned Fire spirits can easily be unleashed on one's enemies. This spell invokes a single Fire kami, which lances toward the target, hitting unerringly so long as the target is within range. The spell deals 2k2 wounds. The burns this spell inflicts are quite painful, and if the spell targets a shugenja who is casting a spell, his Willpower roll has a TN of 20 plus the damage dealt, instead of the normal 10 plus damage dealt.</p>
<p><strong>Extinguish [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 1</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 100' radius</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Area (+20 feet)</li>
</ul>
<p>Fire spirits can be driven away by the proper invocation, a very useful ability in Rokugani towns and cities where the construction is all wood and paper. The spell dismisses the active Fire kami in the area. All non-magical fire in the area of effect is immediately snuffed out, and any damage dealt by fire (magical or not) reduces its DR by 1k1 until the start of the next round.</p>
<p><strong>Fires of Purity [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 1 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: 25'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: 1 minute</li>
<li>Raises: Damage (+1k0 per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell, one of the few directly protective prayers involving the Fire kami, asks the kami to protect one person, enveloping the target in a shroud of bright flames. Neither the target nor anything he carries takes damage from the spell, but anyone who comes into contact with him or strikes him with a melee attack takes 2k2 Wounds. Anyone the target strikes in melee with an unarmed attack or a weapon he carried when the spell was cast also takes an extra 2k2 Wounds. Anything the target puts down, however, cannot be picked back up without subjecting it to the damage from the spell. Ranged weapons such as arrows bypass this barrier of fire, dealing Wounds as normal.</p>
<p><strong>The Fires That Cleanse [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 1</li>
<li>Range: Self</li>
<li>Area: 30' radius</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Area of Effect (+5 feet per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>Destruction is one of the basic impulses of Fire, and this spell calls on that urge to spread destruction in the caster's surroundings. The spell whips the kami into a frenetic chaos, destroying everything around you. everyone in the area of effect, including you, suffers damage with DR equal to your Fire Ring. This result is rolled once and applied to everyone within the area - however, you take only half damage (rounded up), since the kami do make some effort to avoid you.</p>
<p><strong>Fury of Osano-Wo [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 1 (Thunder)</li>
<li>Range: 300'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Damage (+1k0 per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell is actually a prayer to the Fortune of Fire and Thunder, inviting his wrath upon your enemy. It can only be cast outdoors, and summons a bolt of lightning from the sky, striking the target for 5k2 Wounds. Everyone within 10' of the target must make a Stamina roll versus a TN of 15 to avoid being deafened for 2 Rounds. If this spell is cast during a thunderstorm, the damage is increased to 6k2 for a moderate storm and 6k3 for a disastrous storm or hurricane.</p>
<p><strong>Katana of Fire [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 1 (Battle, Craft)</li>
<li>Range: Personal or 20' (see below)</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 created weapon</li>
<li>Duration: 5 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Damage (+1k0), Duration (+5 minutes), Range (+5 feet)</li>
</ul>
<p>You summon a blade of pure fire, blazing like the soul of an honorable warrior. The weapon's default form is a katana, but one Raise can change its form to any other sword of your choosing. The katana has a DR of 2k2. When wielding this weapon, you may use your School Rank in place of your Kenjutsu Skill if you wish. If you do possess the Kenjutsu Skill, you add your Honor Rank to all damage rolls made with this weapon. the katana of fire disappears if it is lost from your hand. Instead of summoning the katana for yourself, you may cause it to appear in the hands of an ally within 20 feet. He is treated as the caster for all purposes of the spell, but does not gain the Honor boost to damage.</p>
<p><strong>Never Alone [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 1</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>duration: 5 Rounds (see below)</li>
<li>Raises: Targets (+1)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell invokes Fire's element of knowledge and understanding, strengthening the spirit of one of your allies by opening his eyes to the courage of his ancestors. The target of the spell receives a bonus to all attack rolls, Skill rolls, and Trait Rolls equal to your Fire Ring. This effect lasts until either the spell expires, or until the target fails an attack roll or Skill Roll, or until the target suffers Wounds from any source, whichever comes first.</p>
<p><strong>The Raging Forge [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 1 (Craft)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 weapon or armor</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>Fire is the element of creation as well as destruction, and a skilled shugenja can use this to great effect. This spell invokes the powers of the forge, mighty and merciless, to remake a material item, such as a weapon or suit of armor, into its perfect form. The target item loses all blemishes, including cracks and nicks. This spell cannot repair an item which has actually been broken or destroyed, however, it can only affect items that are of ordinary quality.</p>
<h1 id="toc1"><span>Mastery Level 2</span></h1>
<p><strong>Disrupt the Aura [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 2</li>
<li>Range: 50'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Target person or creature</li>
<li>Duration: 24 hours</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+12 hours per Raise)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone whose elements are out of balance will feel the effects, and this spell creates this condition deliberately by aggravating the Fire present in the target's body. While the spell is in effect, the target cannot be healed by magical means. Magical spells, items, or Techniques that attempt to restore Wounds to the target automatically fail. (Mundane wound treatment with the Medicine skill will still be effective.) The target may realize something is physically wrong with him but cannot find out what is happening without the help of a shugenja - casting Sense (Fire) will show the presence of many excited Fire spirits within the target.</p>
<p><strong>Enticing the Dance of Flame [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 2</li>
<li>Range: 50'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 20' radius</li>
<li>Duration: 2 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round)</li>
</ul>
<p>A more potent version of The Fires That Cleanse, this spell keeps the Fire kami under tighter control and persuades them to remain present for longer. If the spell is cast successfully, Fire kami erupt into a violent, ferocious dance at a location of your choice, igniting that area into flames. Every target in the area takes 3k2 Wounds on the Round the spell takes effect. At the beginning of each subsequent Round, if the spell is still active, every target still in the affected area takes an additional 2k1 Wounds.</p>
<p><strong>The Fires From Within [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 2</li>
<li>Range: 100'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Target (+1 target per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably the most widely known and recognized offensive spell in the element of Fire, this prayer has been in use by Rokugani shugenja since the very earliest days of the Empire. You summon Fire kami to form an orb of flame that hovers in your palm for a moment before streaking toward the target. The sphere gains momentum and size until it hits its target, making it quite spectacularly visually. The spell has a DR equal to your Fire Ring.</p>
<p><strong>Hurried Steps [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 2</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: 2 rounds (see below)</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>Fire is the element of thought, and thought is swift indeed. You draw upon the speed of Fire kami to aid you in the next spell you cast. The casting time of the next Fire spell you cast is reduced by 4 Rounds. If the next spell is Mastery Level 3 or lower, it casts instantaneously as a Simple Action. If you do not begin casting the new spell within the next 2 Rounds, however, the benefit of Hurried Steps elapses.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Quickness [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 2</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 item</li>
<li>Duration: 10 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>Fire kami can be imbued into physical objects, allowing them to remain present for longer periods of time. Shugenja have devised many ways to use this technique to aid themselves and others. This spell, one of the most basic of this kind, imbues a material item with the cleverness and wit of fire. Anyone who carries that item has their Intelligence Trait increased by 3 for the duration of the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Relentless Heat [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 2 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 armor</li>
<li>Duration: 10 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+2 rounds)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell is designed to protect bushi by infusing a Fire kami into their armor. The spell targets one suit of armor, which glows with the strength of the merciless desert sun. Any opponent who attempts to strike the person wearing the armor, whether or not the attack hits, is immediately considered to be Fatigued until the beginning of their next Turn. The penalty apples to the attack roll that triggered the spell, and any attackers in the Full Attack Posture immediately assume the Attack Posture instead. This spell has no effect on ranged attacks or spells that target the wearer of the armor.</p>
<p><strong>Tail of the Fire Dragon [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 2</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: 4 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell invokes several Fire kami to form a whip-like tendril that extends from the caster's hand. The tendril of flame will not burn you, since the kami are grateful for the opportunity to burn others at your command. You may use this tendril to strike enemies as far as 30' away, extending it out and back with blinding speed. Your attack roll with the tendril is equal to your Agility + (twice your School Rank), keeping your Agility. The tendril has a DR equal to your Fire Ring.</p>
<p><strong>Ward of Purity [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 2 (Ward)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 15' radius from the object touched</li>
<li>Duration: 1 day</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Earth is the traditional method of opposing evil forces like the Shadowlands Taint, the spirits of Fire can also be invoked to purge and destroy such spiritual abominations. This spell binds a Fire kami into a specific location which it protects against the forces of evil. Casting the spell requires inscribing elaborate kanji on a flat surface in chalk or ink, and takes one minute of concentrated effort, after which the Spell Casting Roll must be made. Once the Ward of Purity is activated and the power of the kami is fully engaged, however, the kami within the inscription protects the area against the influence of the Shadowlands or the Lying Darkness.</p>
<p>Persons or creatures with at least 1 Shadowlands Taint Rank, or who are under the control of the Lying Darkness, must make a successful Contested Willpower Roll against you in order to enter the Ward's area of effect; you gain a +5 bonus to this roll. In addition, those creatures who successfully enter the area suffer extreme pain, as the power of the ward burns their very essence. Their bodies ignite and they suffer Wounds equal to the total of your Fire Ring + Insight Rank each Round they remain within the area of effect.</p>
<p>Spells and missiles are unaffected by Ward of Purity. the object upon which the ward is inscribed must remain immobile and the inscription must remain clearly visible at all times, or else the Ward is dispelled.</p>
<p>If overlapping Wards of Purity are present, their effects do not stack.</p>
<h1 id="toc2"><span>Mastery Level 3</span></h1>
<p><strong>Breath of the Fire Dragon [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 3</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 15' long, 5' wide blast</li>
<li>Duration: 4 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell is a prayer to the Dragon of Fire, one of the mightiest of celestial beings, entreating him for a bit of his power. If the spell is successful, you gain the ability to breathe a bolt of flames from your open mouth once per Round as a Simple Action. The bolt has a DR equal to your Fire Ring and strikes every target in front of you within the area of effect. You may choose to take actions other than breathing fire while under the effects of this spell, but you cannot speak or cast spells. The spell expires after four Rounds, but you may choose to end this spell during the Reactions Stage of any earlier Round.</p>
<p><strong>Fiery Wrath [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 3</li>
<li>Range: 100'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: One free-standing structure, or 50' x 50' area</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>Fiery Wrath was originally created to clear brush for farming and to demolish wooden structures with a minimum of work and no hazard; it is also used to start bonfires for rituals and celebrations. The spell allows you to destroy a building or other structure by appealing to the excitable Fire kami within the target's materials. All flammable materials within the area of effect immediately catch fire and burn until nothing but ash is left. The fire cannot be extinguished except by magical means; mundane water, sand, and other retardants will have no effect.</p>
<p>Only one structure may be targeted by the spell, and the fire will not spread out to the adjoining structures, as your prayers keep the Fire kami under tight control. Living beings and materials that are not flammable are not affected; in fact, while clothes worn by people caught within the area of effect will burn, their flesh will not so much as singe.</p>
<p><strong>The Fist of Osano-Wo [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 3 (Thunder)</li>
<li>Range: 50'</li>
<li>Area: 20' radius</li>
<li>Duration: 1 round</li>
<li>Raises: Area of Effect (+10' radius)</li>
</ul>
<p>A more powerful prayer to the Fortune of Thunder, this spell invokes his anger to devastate a targeted area. Massive lightning strikes and vaguely fist-shaped bolts of flame streak from the skies, smiting the area of effect. Weak structures and those easily set on fire (such as most Rokguani homes) are destroyed by the spell's fury, or catch fire and are consumed. The spell has a DR equal to your Fire Ring, inflicting this damage on anyone caught within the area of effect. Using this spell in populated areas is generally considered a criminal act, unless the shugenja can cite extreme circumstances, since fires are terribly dangerous to Rokugani cities.</p>
<p><strong>Haze of Battle [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 3 (Battle)</li>
<li>Range: 10'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: 5 rounds, or 1 hour out of combat</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 Round)</li>
</ul>
<p>Fire spirits are known for their erratic and temperamental nature, and shugenja can badly disrupt their foes in battle by imbuing them with this aspect of the element. The target of this spell is filled with the unfocused fury of Fire, enraging him and forcing him to lose perspective. The target immediately assumes the Full Attack Stance and cannot switch from that Stance for the duration of the spell. If the spell is cast out of battle, the target gains the Brash and Contrary Disadvantages for the duration of the spell.</p>
<p>This spell's effects can be overcome by those of strong will. The target can attempt to resist with an opposed Willpower roll, but you add your Fire to the total of your roll. If the spell is cast in battle, this roll occurs during the Reactions Stage (and may be attempted each Round). If the spell is cast out of battle, the roll occurs every 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Hungry Blade [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 3 (Craft)</li>
<li>Range: 50'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 weapon</li>
<li>Duration: 5 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 Round)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell is a more potent version of Biting Steel, designed to enhance any weapon rather than merely a sword. The spell strengthens the Fire spirits in a single target weapon, causing them to come forth and form a faint sheath of fire around it. The weapon's wielder adds +1k0 to all attack rolls, and all of his damage dice explode on a result of 8 or better. Each die can explode on an 8 or 9 only once per roll, however, even if the wielder has other effects that allow the die to explode on 9s.</p>
<p><strong>Ravenous Swarms [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 3</li>
<li>Range: 30'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target person</li>
<li>Duration: 5 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round)</li>
</ul>
<p>A more powerful and sophisticated form of the prayer which invokes the Fires From Within, this spell not only damages the target but also disrupts his own attempts to invoke Fire kami, making it a very effective weapon against a rival Fire shugenja. You summon forth a bolt of flames that streaks toward the target with wild abandon. The flames deal 5k3 Wounds on impact, and then encircle the opponent for the duration of the spell, waiting for him to make a mistake. If the target casts any Fire spell during that time, the Fire kami instantly strike, dealing 3k3 extra Wounds and causing the Spell Casting Roll to automatically fail. (The target loses the appropriate spell slot as usual.)</p>
<p><strong>Shining Light [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ring/Mastery: Fire 3 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: 30'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target armor</li>
<li>Duration: 10 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Damage (+1k0 per 2 Raises), Duration (+2 Rounds)</li>
</ul>
<p>Another example of spells which can imbue Fire kami into items, this spell temporarily binds a Fire kami into a piece of armor (such as a helmet or chest plate). the armor emits a bright light that becomes blinding whenever the wearer is attacked. Any time the armor's wearer is attacked in melee, immediately afterward the opponent takes 2k2 Wounds and is Blinded until the Reactions Stage of the same Round. The spell has no effect on ranged attacks.</p>
<h1 id="toc3"><span>Mastery Level 4</span></h1>
<p><strong>Death of Flame [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 4</li>
<li>Range: 100'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: 5 Rounds</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell brings the anger of Fire on the target, suppressing his elemental Fire and lowering both his Agility and his Intelligence Ranks by an amount equal to your Fire Ring, to a minimum of 1. If you maintain Concentration for the duration of the spell's effect, the target cannot escape its effects. If you do not maintain Concentration, each Round at the start of his Turn the target may make a Contested Fire roll against you (using his original, unmodified Fire Ring) to end the spell's effect.</p>
<p><strong>Defense of the Firestorm [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 4 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target armor</li>
<li>Duration: 5 Rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 Round)</li>
</ul>
<p>A more potent form of spells like Shining Light, this prayer summons forth an aura of magical flames from a suit of armor, surrounding and protecting the armor's wearer. These flames do not harm the armor's bearer and do not harm living things. However, all wooden weapons (including arrows and many polearms) burn instantly before they reach the target, doing no damage. The flames also impede sight to the target, increasing his Armor TN by 20.</p>
<p><strong>The Mending Forge [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery 4 (Craft)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: One target item</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple and powerful spell has only one function: to call on the creative power of Fire to bring back what has been destroyed. Any damaged or destroyed material item can be restored with this spell, provided all the pieces are gathered in front of the caster. (If someone pieces are missing, the spell will automatically fail.) The spell takes 1 minute to cast, and you must concentrate during that minute. If successful, the spell restores the item to a whole and undamaged state. It should be noted that the Fire kami must worker harder to repair items of unusual quality - if you use this spell to repair a nemuranai or an item of Fine quality or better, you must offer the Fire kami a gift (another item for them to burn and destroy) appropriate to the worth of the item.</p>
<p><strong>Symbol of Fire [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 4 (Ward)</li>
<li>Range: 100'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 10' radius</li>
<li>Duration: Permanent</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>Priests of the kami are capable of inscribing powerful wards that invoke the power of the elements against all who attempt to pass them. A symbol of Fire can be inscribed on a solid object, most often a door, window, gate, or any other passageway. Anyone attempting to pass through this passageway or otherwise pass by the ward is affected by its power, and must succeed at a Contested Roll using their Water against the caster's Fire. Those who fail are Dazed, Blinded fir one Round, and take 3k3 Wounds. This spell may be dispelled by another casting of Symbol of Fire from any shugenja, or by destroying the surface where the Symbol was etched. You may only have one Symbol of Fire in existence at any time, and Symbol spells of different elements may never affect the same area.</p>
<p><strong>Wall of Fire [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 4</li>
<li>Range: 100'</li>
<li>Area: Special</li>
<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>
<li>Raises: Area of Effect (+1 increment, see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>You invoke the Fire kami to spring up and form a wall of flames, barring passage to all. The wall is 10' tall, 1' wide, and 25' long, and causes 6k6 Wounds to anyone who touches it. This wall may be made shorter or thinner as desired, within the total specifications, but all the mass of the flames must be used somehow. The wall may be created in an area where people or creatures are standing, forcing them to make a Reflexes Trait Roll against a TN of 20 to avoid taking Wounds from the fire.<br />
You may Raise to increase on of the specifications (height, width, or length) by its base increment (10', 1', or 25' respectively).</p>
<p><strong>Ward of Thunder [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 4 (Defense, Ward, Thunder)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 15' radius from the armor</li>
<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>Osano-Wo's protection can be temporarily invoked for a suit of armor by casting this spell and inscribing the kanji for thunder on the armor. Those within 15' of the armor are under Osano-Wo's care, and are completely protected from non-magical fire and thunder for the duration of the spell. Additionally, any Fire spell cast by a shugenja other than yourself which targets something within the area of effect has its Spell Casting TN increased by 20</p>
<h1 id="toc4"><span>Mastery Level 5</span></h1>
<p><strong>Destructive Wave [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 5</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 25' radius</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Damage (+1k1 per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>A highly potent offensive spell, originally devised by the Isawa Elemental Masters, this prayer summons up a great mass of Fire kami, which roll outward from the caster in a wave of searing flames. Every target within the area of effect, whether friendly or hostile, takes 7k7 Wounds, for the raging flames makes no distinction between ally and enemy. You alone do not take damage from the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Everburning Rage [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 5</li>
<li>Range: 25'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration 1 Round</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 Round), Targets (+1)</li>
</ul>
<p>A powerful curse that infuses the target's body with angry Fire spirits, wracking him with pain as the kami sear his nerves and ligaments. For the duration of the spell, the victim is considered to be at the Down Wound Level and suffers all associated penalties and conditions, although he takes no actual Wounds from the spell. When the spell expires, the pain instantly ceases and the target may stand up as if nothing had happened. This spell is somewhat controversial with some shugenja schools, particularly the more peaceful ones, since it amounts to little more than the deliberate infliction of pain. A few shugenja have even noted certain disturbing similarities between this spell's effects and those of certain maho curses.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the Flame [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 5</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: See below</li>
<li>Duration: 5 Rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Damage (+1k0 per Raise)</li>
</ul>
<p>this spell grants you exceptional control of the nearby Fire kami, allowing you to coax them into a very unusual and terrifying attack. On the Round this spell is cast and every Round thereafter, you may declare a line of sight target within 300' and send a stream of fire toward it that snakes along the ground (on later Rounds, designating a target in this manner is a Simple Action). the stream of fire moves at a rate of 75' each Round and moves around impassable (or inflammable) barriers in order to reach its target. Once the fire reaches its destination, the target bursts into flames, suffering 6k5 Wounds. The subject catches fire and takes half that many Wounds (rounded down) every subsequent Round until the fire is doused normally or the spell's duration expires.</p>
<p><strong>Light of the Sun [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 5 (Jade)</li>
<li>Range: 100'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 30' radius</li>
<li>Duration: 10 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>This prayer invokes the power of the Sun, worshiped and venerated throughout Rokugan, and is an especial favorite among the Moshi family, although shugenja all across the Empire have learned it. The spell calls down a concentrated beam of pure sunlight to punish the unworthy. Everyone caught in the area of effect takes 2k2 Wounds per Round from the intense heat. Human targets (only) take an additional 2k1 Wounds for every Honor Rank they are below 4, and an additional 2k2 Wounds if they possess at least 1 Rank of the Shadowlands Taint or are controlled by the Lying Darkness. Human targets who have an Honor Rank of 0 are Blinded for a number of Rounds equal to your Fire Ring.</p>
<p><strong>Wings of the Phoenix [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 5 (Travel)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: 10 Rounds</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>The Phoenix is one of the most powerful symbols of Fire known to the Rokugani, and this spell calls on the essence of that being to grant its casters the power of flight. When this spell is cast, you summon clouds of Fire kami who take the form of giant wings sprouting from your back. You gain the ability to fly for the duration of the spell, moving at a speed of Water x 10 for a Free Action or Water x 20 for a Simple Action. If you are airborne when the spell expires, the Fire kami will bear you down to earth before departing.</p>
<h1 id="toc5"><span>Mastery Level 6</span></h1>
<p><strong>Beam of the Inferno [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 6</li>
<li>Range: 200'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>This is perhaps the deadliest single spell available to shugenja, and one of the most fearsome spells ever developed in the Empire. The prayer invokes a tremendous blast of fire against the chosen target, who takes 10k10 Wounds. The spell puts all the Fire kami in the area into a state of agitation, and normal fires within range will burn hotter and more violently for many minutes after this spell is cast.</p>
<p><strong>Globe of the Everlasting Sun [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 6 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: 500'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 mile</li>
<li>Duration: 1 day</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>This mighty prayer calls on all the Fire kami in the area to remain quiet and calm, soothing the agitation which so often afflicts them. It is often invoked during major festivals such as the crowning of a new Emperor. For the duration of the spell, all buildings within the area of effect are immune to the effects of magical fire, and all Fire spells cast within the area have the TN of their spell Casting Rolls increased by 15. Normal fires will still ignite and burn, but they do so sluggishly, and do not spread easily.</p>
<p><strong>The Soul's Blade [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Fire 6 (Craft)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target weapon</li>
<li>Duration: 5 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 Round per 3 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell imbues incredibly powerful Fire kami into a weapon, granting it the full fury of a raging firestorm. A bushi armed with this weapon is a terrible opponent, for the Fire spirits shock and daze his enemies with every blow. For the duration of the spell, the weapon will overcome Invulnerability, and every target hit with it is automatically Stunned.</p>
