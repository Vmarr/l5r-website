<h1 id="toc0"><span>Mastery Level 1</span></h1>
<p><strong>Armor of Earth [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 1 (Battle, Defense)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: 10 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+2 rounds)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell infuses the caster's body with the strength of Earth, weakening the force of any physical or magical attack which strikes him. For the duration of the spell, you gain Reduction in an amount equal to your Earth Ring + School Rank. However, this infusion of Earth slows your movements - you Water is considered 1 Rank lower for purposes of movement while you are under the effects of this spell.</p>
<p><strong>Courage of the Seven Thunders [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 1 (Battle)</li>
<li>Range: 30'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Targets up to caster's Shugenja School Rank</li>
<li>Duration: 10 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 minute), Targets (+1)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell infuses the targets (who may include the caster) with firm and unyielding courage, bolstered by the eternal power of the Earth. For the duration of the spell, all targets gain +5k0 to resist any kind of Fear effect, whether magical or natural. However, this spell is associated with the memory of the legendary Seven Thunders, and those whose connection to the Thunders is tenuous do not receive the same degree of blessing from the Earth kami. Samurai who are not of the original Seven Great Clans receive only +3k0 to their rolls to resist Fear. Anyone who has at least a full Rank of Shadowlands Taint cannot benefit from this spell, although this will not actually reveal that they are Tainted.</p>
<p>This spell may be cast as a combined ritual by two or more shugenja who know the spell, in which case they may add their highest single Earth Rank to their combined total School Ranks to determined how many targets the spell can affect.</p>
<p><strong>Earth's Stagnation [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 1</li>
<li>Range: 50'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: One target</li>
<li>Duration: 6 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+2 rounds), Range (+10'), Targets (+1, to a maximum of 4 total targets)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell calls on the Earth in the target's body to weigh him down, impeding his movements. The target suffers a -2k0 penalty to all rolls using the Agility trait, and his Water Ring is considered 1 Rank lower for the purposes of how far he can move.</p>
<p><strong>Earth's Touch [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 1 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: One target</li>
<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1/2 hour), Targets (+1 per 2 raises, maximum of 3 total targets)</li>
</ul>
<p>With this spell, the shugenja calls forth the Earth of the target (which may be himself), invoking the kami to strengthen his health and mental fortitude. For the duration of the spell, one of the target's Earth Traits (chosen by the caster) is increased by 1. This does not increase the Ring itself, but it can enhance the target's ability to withstand temptation, resist poisons, or dominate others.</p>
<p><strong>Elemental Ward [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 1 (Wards)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: One Target</li>
<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1/2 hour), Targets (+1 per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell uses the power of the Earth to enhance the resistance to hostile magic. The spirits of the Earth armor the target's body and soul, rejecting other kami when they try to affect the target. When the shugenja casts this spell, he chooses one Element (which cannot be Void or Maho). Spells of that element suffer a penalty equal to the caster's School Rank x 5 when they are cast on anyone under the protection of this spell. (Unfortunately, this includes &quot;friendly&quot; magic such as healing.)</p>
<p><strong>Jade Strike [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 1 (Jade, Thunder)</li>
<li>Range: 100'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: One target</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Damage (+1k0), Range (+10'), Targets (+1 target, maximum of 5 total targets)</li>
</ul>
<p>This summons forth the purest of Earth kami, those of jade, in the form of a blast of iridescent green energy. The jade power flies out and unerringly strikes the chosen target - it cannot be intercepted or deflected, although Magic Resistance or other forms of magical defense can thwart it. If the target has at least one Rank of Taint, the Jade Strike will inflict damage with a DR of 3,3, burning and blackening the Tainted flesh. However, a target who does not have at least a full Rank of Taint will not suffer any damage from the spell. Casting Jade Strike on a non-Tainted target is generally regarded as a grave insult - except perhaps among the more paranoid ranks of the Kuni family, where it is seen as merely a sensible precaution.</p>
<p><strong>Jurojin's Balm [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 1</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1/2 hour), Targets (+1 per 2 Raises, maximum of 5 total targets)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell fills the target's body with the purity and vigor of Earth, driving out poisons and impurities. If the target suffers the effects of any poison or toxin within the duration of the spell, or is already under the effects of a poison when the spell targets him, he may re-roll any failed Stamina roll to resist the poison, with a bonus of +2k0 to the second roll. (However, if the second roll is also failed, the poison has full effect.) An interesting side-effect of this spell is that it also cures drunkenness and other such effects, and it is impossible to become intoxicated during the spell's duration.</p>
<p><strong>Minor Binding [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 1 (Craft)</li>
<li>Range: 60'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: 2 hours</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 hour), Range (+20')</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell was pioneered by the Kuni family but has come into use among other shugenja who battle the forces of the Shadowlands, such as the Scorpion and the Phoenix. It is used to safely imprison minor Shadowlands creatures, typically for purposes of interrogation. Any Shadowlands creature with an Earth of 3 or less can be targeted with this spell. It cannot affect the Lost, Oni Lords or their spawn, or creatures with an Earth of 4 or higher, nor can it affect creatures who are not Tainted.</p>
<p>If the spell is cast successfully, it calls forth manacles of iron, formed from pure Earth spirits, which trap and bind the target creature, rendering it physically helpless for the duration of the spell. When the spell expires, the manacles instantly crumble away into dust.</p>
<p><strong>Soul of Stone [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 1 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: one Target</li>
<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1/2 hour)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell fills the target's soul with the firm and unyielding strength of stone. For the duration of the spell, the target's feelings are immovable, and any attempt to divert or distract him will be resisted with supernatural determination. He gains a +3k0 bonus to any rolls made to resist emotional manipulation or the distractions of desire, including Courtier (Manipulation) rolls, Temptation rolls, Compulsions, and any similar effect the GM judges to be appropriate. However, this stony self-control also makes it difficult for the target to read and affect the emotions of others, and for the duration of the spell he suffers a -1k0 penalty to all Awareness Trait rolls and Awareness-related Skill Rolls made for the purpose of influencing others.</p>
<p><strong>Tetsubo of Earth [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 1 (Craft, Jade)</li>
<li>Range: Personal or 20'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: One created weapon</li>
<li>Duration: 5 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Damage (+1k0), Duration (+5 minutes), Range (+5 feet)</li>
</ul>
<p>You summon a tetsubo of pure earth, studded with all manner of stones. The weapon's default form is a tetsubo, but one Raise can change its form to any other heavy weapon of your choosing. The tetsubo has a DR of 2k2. When wielding this weapon, you may use your School Rank in place of your Heavy Weapon Skill if you wish. If you do have the Heavy Weapon Skill, the tetsubo grants you a Free Raise for the Knockdown maneuver (this bonus does not apply if you grant the Tetsubo to another person instead of wielding it yourself). The tetsubo disappears if it is lost from your hand. Instead of summoning for yourself, you may cause it to appear in the hands of an ally within 20 feet. He is treated as the caster for all purposes of the spell, but does not gain the Free Raise bonus.</p>
<h1 id="toc1"><span>Mastery Level 2</span></h1>
<p><strong>Be the Mountain [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 2 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: 30'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: 4 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round)</li>
</ul>
<p>A variant of the spell Armor of Earth, designed to protect allies, this prayer causes the Earth kami to envelop the target with their embrace, covering his skin with a stony barrier that repels physical blows. The target gains Reduction of a value equal to 5 x the caster's School Rank, to a maximum of 20, but cannot take Simple Move Actions for the duration of the spell (Free Move Actions are still allowed). Only a willing ally can be targeted with this spell.</p>
<p><strong>Earth Becomes Sky [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 2 (Jade, Thunder)</li>
<li>Range: 100'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Damage (+1k0), Targets (+1 target), Special (make boulders Jade with 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell summons up several huge boulders from the earth, and hurls them through the air to unerringly strike one (or more) target creatures. The target struck by these boulders suffers damage with a DR equal to the caster's Earth rank. If the caster strikes multiple targets, the DR is reduced by 1k1 for each additional target, to a minimum of 1k1 damage per target. These boulders are made of normal, mundane stone, and thus cannot normally bypass Reduction or Invulnerability, but a powerful caster can infuse the boulders with the power of Jade.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace of Kenro-Ji-Jin [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 2 (Travel)</li>
<li>Range: Personal or Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1/2 hour)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell allows the target (who can be the caster or one other person) to literally dive into the ground, which becomes as clear and easy to traverse as water for him. He can see for a distance of 100 yards through the earth, and can move through it in any direction as easily as though he were in normal air. The target can see through the edge of the earth into the normal world, but he cannot attack, cast spells, speak, hear, or otherwise interact with those outside the earth unless he emerges from the ground (at which point the spell immediately ends). If the spell ends while the target is still underground, the Earth spirits are offended by the target's continued presence, and immediately expels him into the nearest open air, wherever that might be.</p>
<p><strong>Force of Will [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 2 (Battle)</li>
<li>Range: 50'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: 2 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round, maximum 4 Rounds duration)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell infuses the target with an intense resistance to pain and death, as the Earth kami bolster his will to live to supernatural levels. He is able to shrug off the pain and shock of his wounds, even continuing in the face of lethal injuries for a short time. For the duration of the spell, the target is immune to all Wound Rank penalties and effects - including the effect of being dead if the Out rank is completely filled. When the spell expires, however, the full effects of any Wounds apply immediately - thus, this spell typically affords either a brief chance to be healed before it is too late, or the chance to wage a final battle in the face of certain death.</p>
<p><strong>Grasp of Earth [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 2</li>
<li>Range: 50'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: 5 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round), Range (5'), Targets (+1 target per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell causes the Earth kami to reach up and seize hold of the target, often taking the form of a massive hand or claw which grips the unfortunate creature in stony digits. The target is rendered near-immobile, able to move only 3' per round as a Simple Move Action, and unable to move at all with a Free Move Action. The target may break free by spending a Complex Action and rolling Raw Strength at a TN equal to 5 x the caster's Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Hands of Clay [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 2 (Travel)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: 10 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+5 minutes)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell infuses Earth spirits into the hands and feet of the caster, allowing them to merge with the Earth found in wood, earth, and stone. This allows the caster to walk and climb along sheer surfaces, including walls and cliffs, at half his normal movement speed (rounded up). He can even hand from ceilings and move along them, although in that case he can only move 3' with a Simple Action. When the spell ends, the effect concludes without warning, possibly leading to a painful fall.</p>
<p><strong>The Mountain's Feet [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 2 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: Personal or 20'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1/2 hour), Targets (+1 per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell fortifies the target by rooting his feet to the stone and soil beneath, allowing him to shrug off anything that might separate him from the touch of the Earth. The target gains +3k0 to resist all Knockdown maneuvers, and any spell which seeks to knock down the target, lift him into the air, or otherwise break his connection to the Earth must win a Contested roll of the spell's Element against the caster's Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Wholeness of the World [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 2 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: Personal or 20'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: 10 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 minute), Range (+5'), Targets (+1 per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell infuses the target with the strength of Earth to such a degree that his Rings and Traits become wholly resistant to any effort to change them. Any physical or magical effect which would raise or lower his Traits or Rings is completely ineffective for the duration of the spell, as the Eart kami firmly rebuff any such efforts to alter the target's Elemental balance.</p>
<h1 id="toc2"><span>Mastery Level 3</span></h1>
<p><strong>Bonds of Ningen-Do [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 3 (Wards)</li>
<li>Range: 500'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target spirit creature</li>
<li>Duration: 30 days</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 day_, Range (+10'), Targets (+1 per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell, a more powerful and specialized form of Minor Binding, is a ritual designed to bind or dispel troublesome creatures from the various spirit realms. Any creature from the realms of Sakkaku, Chikushudo, Gaki-Do, Toshigoku, or Yume-Do can be affected by this spell. Casting it requires 10 minutes, although if additional shugenja who know the spell assist in the ritual, the time is reduced by 1 minute per additional shugenja, to a minimum of 1 minute.</p>
<p>If the targeted creature is within range of the caster(s) when the spell is successfully completed, the creature can be either bound or dispelled. If it is bound, it must obey the caster's commands for the duration of the spell, although suicidal commands will break the spell - this is how the Kuni have forced mujina spirits to labor for them in their iron mines. (It should be noted that this use of the spell is considered controversial and even blasphemous by many in Rokugan.) If the creature is dispelled, it immediately leaves Ningen-Do for its native spirit realm, and cannot return until the spell's duration ends. Either way, the spirit creature will regard the caster as an enemy thereafter, and is likely to seek vengeance if it can.</p>
<p><strong>Earth Kami's Blessing [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 3 (Battle)</li>
<li>Range: Personal or 20'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Caster or 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: 10 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 minute)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell infuses the target (which may be the caster or one of his allies) with the strength and resilience of the Earth, making him tougher and more firm-minded. For the duration of the spell, the target gains +2 Wounds per Wound Rank, and gains +1k1 on all rolls involving the Earth Ring and its associated Traits. When the spell expires, any Wounds the target has suffered still remain, and this may drive him into a lower Wound Rank or even kill him.</p>
<p><strong>Earth's Protection [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 3 (Defense, Wards)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 10' radius from caster</li>
<li>Duration: Concentration</li>
<li>Raises: Area (+5' radius per 2 Raises, to a maximum of 30' radius), Special (Damage reduced by an additional +1k1 for 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell calls on the spirits of Earth to protect the area around the caster from the effects o the other three Elements (Air, Fire, and Water) for a short time. While the caster concentrates on maintaining the favor the Earth spirits, the effects of spells which call on those other three elements are mitigated. Any hostile Air, Fire, or Water spell cast within the area of Earth's Protection, or extending its effects into that area, will suffer a +10&#160;TN penalty to the Spell Casting roll. In addition, any damage which those spells inflict on creatures within Earth's Protection will be reduced by 1k1 (to a minimum of 1k1).</p>
<p><strong>Purge the Taint [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 3 (Jade)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 50' radius around caster</li>
<li>Duration: Permanent</li>
<li>Raises: Area (+10' radius)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell was originally created by the Kuni family and is still primarily practiced by them, although knowledge of its prayers has spread to other Clans. It is an elaborate ritual spell, requiring an hour to cast, that calls on the powers of Earth to purge the land of the Shadowlands Taint, driving out all the evil kansen in the area. The spell will remove the Taint from the land, plant life, and inanimate objects within the area of effect. It will not remove Taint from living creatures, nor will it affect powerful Tainted artifacts or objects made of obsidian.</p>
<p>The removal of the Taint, however, is not without a price. The elemental kami in the area of effect are also weakened and purged by the spell, especially the Earth spirits whose efforts are called upon to power it. In the aftermath of casting this spell, the local spirits are scattered and weakened, inflicting a +15&#160;TN penalty on all Spell Casting rolls within the area. This negative effect will sometimes fade with time, especially if it was cast in a single location surrounded by normal lands. But if the spell is cast over a wide area, such as the Kuni Wastes, the elemental kami will usually permanently leave the area, reducing it to a gray, lifeless wasteland.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing the Strength of Many [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 3</li>
<li>Range: 20'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 - 6 target persons within range</li>
<li>Duration: 5 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round), Range (+5')</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell infuses its targets, up to six people (who can include the caster), with the power of Earth, allowing them each to call upon the Earth of their comrades to bolster their efforts. For the duration of the spell, the lowest Earth Ring Tank among all the targets is added to the total of all Ring, Trait, and Skill rolls (but not Spell Casting rolls) the make.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of the Crow [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 3 (Jade)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target</li>
<li>Duration: Hours equal to caster's Shugenja School Rank</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 hour), Targets (+1)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell infuses the target (who can be the caster) with a powerful resistance to the Shadowlands Taint, repelling the dark kansen of the Taint with the pure power of Earth. For the duration of the spell, the target(s) gain a +5k5 bonus to all rolls made to resist gaining the Shadowlands Taint, and any maho spells suffer a +10&#160;TN penalty to affect them. This bonus does not apply to any rolls made to resist an increase in Taint the target already possesses - it only applies to new Taint gained from outside sources. Likewise it cannot protect the target from gaining Taint by casting Maho.</p>
<p><strong>The Wolf's Mercy [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 3</li>
<li>Range: 50'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: 10 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Range (+10'), Targets (+1)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell has existed in Rokugan for centuries, but is best known for its extensive use by Toturi Sezaru, &quot;the Wolf&quot;, who employed it during his hunts for Bloodspeakers. It calls on the power of the Earth to afflict the target, weighing down his body and impeding his muscles, leaving him weak and vulnerable.</p>
<p>The target's Earth Ring is lowered by 1 Rank, and his Wound Ranks are reduced correspondingly for the duration of the spell. (This can potentially kill him immediately if he already suffered Wounds.) In addition, his Strength Rank is also lowered by 1 for the same duration. If the target has at least one full Rank of the Shadowlands Taint, the Earth spirits will be filled with wrath, and punish him more severely, lowering his Earth Ring by 2 Ranks (to a minimum of 1).</p>
<h1 id="toc3"><span>Mastery Level 4</span></h1>
<p><strong>Armor of the Emperor [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 4 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: 5 Rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+2 Rounds)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell covers the caster in a thick layer of tough, resilient Earth spirits who repel all damage, whether physical blows or magical effects. Any time the caster suffers damage from an enemy physical or magical attack, each individual damage die has its total Reduced by the caster's Shugenja School Rank. This cannot reduce a die's total below 0.</p>
<p><strong>Essence of Earth [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 4 (Battle)</li>
<li>Range: Personal or 20'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature (self or another)</li>
<li>Duration: 10 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round), Range (+5'), Targets (+1 per 2 Raises), Special (+1 Rank of Earth per 2 Raises, maximum increase 3 Ranks of Earth)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell infuses the target with the true strength of Earth, allowing him to shrug off blows which might otherwise take his life. For the duration of the spell, the target's Earth Ring is considered to be 1 Rank higher, and his Wounds are increased correspondingly. However, when the spell ends, the Earth spirits immediately depart and the target's Wounds return to normal - possibly resulting in death, if he has suffered sufficient injury.</p>
<p><strong>Symbol of Earth [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 4 (Wards)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Special</li>
<li>Duration: Permanent</li>
<li>Raises: Damage (+1k0)</li>
</ul>
<p>Priests of the kami are capable of inscribing powerful wards that invoke the power of the elements against all who attempt to pass them. A symbol of Earth can be inscribed on a solid object, most often a door, window, gate, or any other passageway. Anyone attempting to pass through this passageway or otherwise pass the ward is affected by its power, and must succeed a Contested Roll using their Air against the caster's Earth. Those who fail are struck with a powerful shockwave, and must succeed at a Strength roll against the total of the Spell Casting Roll used to create the ward or be knocked Prone and Stunned. If they have at least one Rank of Taint, they also suffer 2k2 Wounds. You may only have one Symbol of Earth in existence at any time, and Symbol spells of different elements may never affect the same area. This spell can be dispelled by another casting of Symbol of Earth from any shugenja, or by destroying the surface where the Symbol was etched.</p>
<p><strong>Tomb of Jade [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 4 (Jade)</li>
<li>Range: 50'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: Concentration</li>
<li>Raises: Range (+10'), Special (Contested Roll, +1k1 to caster for each Raise)</li>
</ul>
<p>Considered by many shugenja to be the ultimate spell for opposing the creatures of the Shadowlands, this spell calls on the purest of Earth spirits, those of jade, to consume the very Taint within the target. The spell can only affect a target who has at least one full Rank of Shadowlands Taint, but if the spell fails, the caster will not automatically know that the target is Taint-free - there is always the possibility that the target was able to resist the spell.</p>
<p>When Tomb of Jade is cast, the target is momentarily immobilized as the Earth spirits enter his body. Each round, starting with the first round, the caster must make a Contested Earth roll against the target. If the target wins, the spell ends. If the caster wins, the target takes 2k2 Wounds as the spirits begin to transform his body into jade. This continues each round until the target successfully resists, the caster stops concentrating, or the target dies. Those killed by this spell are transformed into statues of pure jade, which crumbles away into mundane dust in 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Wall of Earth [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 4 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: 100'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Wall measuring a maximum of 10' high and 100' wide</li>
<li>Duration: 10 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Area (increase height by 1' or width by 10' per Raise), Duration (+1 minute), Range (+10')</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell coaxes the spirits of Earth into rising up and forming a thick, powerful barrier to protect the caster. The wall of rock-hard earth which this spell creates can be shaped as the caster desires, and can be curved, placed on a side of a hill, or even formed in a circle. It is extremely tough, requiring a Strength Roll against a TN of the caster's (Earth + School Rank) x 5 in order to break through. It is strong enough to hold back a raging flood, a lava flow, or hurricane winds, at least as long as the spell lasts. When the spell expires, however, the earthen barrier crumbles away in moments.</p>
<h1 id="toc4"><span>Mastery Level 5</span></h1>
<p><strong>Earthquake [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 5</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 mile radius</li>
<li>Duration: 1 minute</li>
<li>Raises: Area (+500 yards), Duration (+1 minute per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell unleashes a terrible, ground-wracking earthquake, centered on the caster, who alone is unaffected. The earthquake utterly destroys all wooden buildings within the radius of effect, and inflicts severe damage on stone structures. All persons within the area of the earthquake are thrown to the ground, and remain Prone and Stunned for the duration of the spell, as well as suffering 2k1 Wounds. Individuals who are inside buildings (including the caster) will suffer 6k6 damage from falling debris, collapsing roofs, etc. Casting this spell within range of a major inhabited area is generally considered an act of war.</p>
<p><strong>Major Binding [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 5 (Jade, Wards)</li>
<li>Range: 100'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target Shadowlands creature</li>
<li>Duration: 12 hours</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 hour), Range (+50')</li>
</ul>
<p>The more powerful counterpart to the Kuni family's Minor Binding spell, this spell has also been employed by other clan shugenja, especially those of the Phoenix Clan. It is used to imprison more powerful Shadowlands creatuers and members of the Lost, typically for purposes of interrogation. Any Lost and any Shadowlands creature can be targeted with this spell. It can also target other spirit creatures who are Tainted. it cannot affect any other creatures.</p>
<p>The spell is a ritual, and requires ten minutes to cast (making it quite hazardous when dealing with a rampaging oni), but if additional shugenja join in casting the spell the casting is reduced by 1 minute per shugenja, to a minimum of 1 minute. If it is cast successfully, the casters make a Contested Roll of their combined Earth Rings against the Earth of the target. If the casters win, the spell calls forth manacles of pure elemental jade, which imprison the creature and render it helpless with the pain of its searing bonds for the duration of the spell. When the spell expires, however, the manacles instantly crumble into dust, and the creature is liable to seek immediate and bloody vengeance on its captors.</p>
<p><strong>Strike at the Roots [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 5</li>
<li>Range: 50'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: 3 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round), Range (+10'), Targets (+1 per 2 Raises), Special (Contested Roll, +1k1 to the caster for each Raise)</li>
</ul>
<p>A more powerful and devastating form of the Wolf's Mercy, this spell brings the true wrath of the Earth onto the target, draining all favor of the Earth from his body and leaving him a weak, trembling, helpless victim. After casting this spell, the caster must succeed in a Contested Earth roll against the target of the spell (rolling separately if he is targeting multiple people). If the target loses the roll, his Earth Ring is immediately reduced to 1 for the duration of the spell. This also reduces his Wound Ranks and may result in his immediate death if he has already suffered injuries.</p>
<p><strong>The Kami's Strength [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 5 (Battle)</li>
<li>Range: 30'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: 5 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round), Range (+10')</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell allows the caster to fortify one person with the power of the Earth, greatly enhancing their physical capabilities and their resistance to damage. The target of the spell gains Reduction of 20 and increases his Strength and one other physical Trait by an amount equal to the caster's Earth Ring. In return, however, the target is weighed down by the burden of Earth and cannot take Simple Move Actions (he can still take a Free Move Action).</p>
<p><strong>The Kami's Will [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 5 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: 30'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: 10 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round), Range (+10')</li>
</ul>
<p>The counterpoint to the Kami's Strength, this spell infuses one person with the stubbornness and determination of Earth, greatly enhancing their willpower and making them all but immune to the effects of elemental magic. The target of this spell increases his Willpower by an amount equal to the caster's Earth Ring, and any spells (friendly or hostile, but not including Maho spells) which target him suffer a penalty of -XkX to their Spell Casting Roll, where X is the caster's Earth Ring. In return, however, the target is so stubborn and willful that he cannot function properly in a social environment,and suffers a penalty to all Social Skill rolls of -Xk0, where X is the Earth Ring of the caster.</p>
<h1 id="toc5"><span>Mastery Level 6</span></h1>
<p><strong>Essence of Jade [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 6 (Defense, Jade)</li>
<li>Range: 30'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: 10 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round), Range (+5'), Targets (+1 target per 2 Raises, maximum of 3 total targets)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell calls on the purity of jade to protect its targets against the power of Jigoku, whether manifested as Taint or as the dreaded magic known as maho. The target radiates the sacred green light of jade, and while the spell lasts, he cannot gain the Shadowlands Taint and is completely immune to the effects of all maho spells. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who possesses at least one full Rank of Taint, for the pure jade spirits will recoil from such a corrupt individual, immediately alerting the caster to this individual's Tainted nature.</p>
<p><strong>Power of the Earth Dragon [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 6 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: 50'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: 10 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 minute), Range (+10'), Targets (+1), Special (Damage absorption +10 Wounds per Raise)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell is the most powerful of the physically protective Earth spells, calling on the favor of the Dragon of Earth to enshroud the targets with protection against all forms of harm. The Earth spirits absorb all damage which the targets suffer while the spell lasts. However, there are limits to even Earth's endurance. Nemuranai can bypass the protection. Further, if the Earth spirits protecting a specific target absorb a total of 100 Wounds of damage, they will be exhausted and the spell's effects on that target come to an end.</p>
<p><strong>Prison of Earth [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 6 (Wards)</li>
<li>Range: 30'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: Permanent</li>
<li>Raises: Range (+5'), Special (Contested Roll, +1k1 to the caster for each Raise)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most powerful of the binding spells which Earth shugenja use to deal with dangerous creatures, this spell can literally imprison the essence of such a creature for as long as the caster desires. Casting this spell requires that the caster possess a gem or pearl in which to imprison the creature (the GM may, discretionally, allow other rare or precious items to be used, such as a beautifully inlaid puzzle-box or a crystal pendant). The spell can target any creature native to the realms of Jigoku, Gaki-do, or Toshigoku, and any other non-human creature with at least 1 full Rank of Taint.</p>
<p>After casting the spell, the caster must make a Contested Willpower roll against the target. If the caster wins, the creature's physical body vanishes and its essence is imprisoned within the item. It will remain there indefinitely unless the item is physically destroyed. If that happens, the released creature immediately resumes its physical form, and will most likely seek vengeance against the caster or his descendants.</p>
<p><strong>Rise, Earth [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Earth 6</li>
<li>Range: 30'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 summoned spirit</li>
<li>Duration: Concentration</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>The Earth itself arises and takes form to defend you. The ultimate realization of the Summon spell, this prayer summons a massive kami of pure Earth to serve you. It takes the form of a vaguely humanoid shape, roughly ten feet in height, with a broad body and thick limbs all formed of earth and stone. This mighty Earth kami may move up to 5 x your earth per round, and its footsteps shake the earth in a twenty foot radius around it, preventing anyone from making Simple Move Actions within its area of effect. This Earth spirit is treated as if it has all Physical Traits equal to your Earth Ring, and attacks with a Jiujutsu Skill rank equal to half your Earth Ring. The kami can carry up to 1,000 pounds of weight if so commanded, and its blows are strong enough to destroy any wooden structure and to shatter stone walls of one-foot thickness. For purposes of taking damage, the spirit is considered to have Wounds as though it were a human with Earth equal to your Earth Ring, but suffers no Wound penalties. It is Invulnerable. If it is successfully reduced to zero wounds, it is dispelled.</p>
