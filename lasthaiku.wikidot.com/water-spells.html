<p><strong>Bo of Water [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 1 (Craft)</li>
<li>Range: Personal or 20' (see below)</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 created weapon</li>
<li>Duration: 5 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Damage (+1k0), Duration (+5 minutes), Range (+5')</li>
</ul>
<p>You summon a staff of pure water, as rigid as the real thing despite its fluid nature. The weapon's default form is a bo, but one Raise can change its form to any other staff of your choosing. The weapon has DR 1k2. If you do not possess the Staves Skill, you may instead use your School Rank in its place. If you do possess the Staves Skill, using this weapon grants you one Free Raise that can only be used on the Knockdown Maneuver. This weapon disappears if it is lost from your hand. Instead of summoning the bo for yourself, you may cause it to appear in the hands of an ally within 20 feet. He is treated as the caster for all purposes of the spell, but he does not gain the Free Raise bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity of Purpose [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 1 (Battle)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 10' radius around caster</li>
<li>Duration: 2 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Area (+5'), Duration (+1 round per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the many strengths of water is in its speed. All allies within the area of effect of this spell gain a bonus of +5 to their Initiative Scores for the duration of the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Ebbing Strength [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 1 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: 20'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target creature</li>
<li>Duration: 3 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round), Range (+5')</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy flows through the universe just as water flows through the mortal shell. You may send your energy to another, weakening yourself and strengthening them in the process. You may reduce any one of your Physical Traits by an amount up to your School Rank. The target of this spell increases the same Physical Trait by the same amount. If your Trait is reduced to 0 as a result of this spell, you immediately fall unconscious and the spell's duration is reduced to 1 round. No Trait may be enhanced above double its normal rank by this spell.</p>
<p><strong>Path to Inner Peace [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 1</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>The water kami can influence the flow of water through the body, dramatically hastening the natural healing process. You can use this spell to heal Wounds that another individual has suffered. This spell restores a number of Wounds to the target equal to the amount by which the Spell Casting Roll exceeded the spell's TN to cast.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections of Pan Ku [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 1 (Divination)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 object</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>Divining the abilities of an object is among the simplest lessons a student of water learns in the temple. If this spell is successfully cast on an object, you automatically learn all powers and abilities that object possesses. This is most frequently used to identify any supernatural qualities an item possesses, such as a nemuranai or a cursed weapon, but it can also identify the spell contained within a shugenja's prayer scroll. This spell will not allow a shugenja to read a scroll if it is written in a cipher he does not understand, but he can at least identify the spell in question. This spell will also grant the caster knowledge of the item's origin in very broad strokes, such as where it was forged, the Clan of the individual who has carried it the longest, or something similar at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Reversal of Fortunes [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 1</li>
<li>Range: 10'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual</li>
<li>Duration: 3 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round), Range (+5')</li>
</ul>
<p>Versatility is the domain of water, and those who carry its blessing reap the rewards. For the duration of this spell, the target may immediately re-roll any one roll per round. This must be done immediately after the first roll is completed, and the target may keep either result.</p>
<p><strong>The Rushing Wave [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 1 (Travel)</li>
<li>Range: 10'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual</li>
<li>Duration: 1 round</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round), Range (+5')</li>
</ul>
<p>You can temporarily increase the speed of your target. This spell allows the target to make a Free Move Action of up his Water Ring x 10' (instead of the normal x 5'). Without Raises for Duration, this benefit must be used on the target's next Turn or it is lost.</p>
<p><strong>Speed of the Waterfall [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 1 (Travel)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual or creature</li>
<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+10 minutes), Range (may increase to 10' for 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those filled with the essence of water find their movement far faster than ever before. The target of this spell may move a total distance per round equal to their Water x 20' plus an amount equal to twice your Water Ring. This spell does not grant the target additional movement, it simply increases the maximum possible amount they can move during a Round for the duration of the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Spirit of the Water [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 1 (Battle)</li>
<li>Range: 20'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Range (+5'), Special (Increase additional action to Complex for 5 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>The spirit of water is both fluid and rapid. The target gains one additional Simple Action during the Reactions Stage of the Round in which this spell is completed. This Action cannot be used to make an attack.</p>
<p><strong>Sympathetic Energies [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 1</li>
<li>Range: 25'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Range (+5'), Special (see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy flows between all living things as water flows through the earth. You may transfer any one existing spell effect from you to the willing target of this spell. With 3 Raises, you may transfer 1 spell effect from one living target to another willing target. You cannot transfer spells between unwilling targets.</p>
<h1 id="toc1"><span>Mastery Level 2</span></h1>
<p><strong>Cloak of the Miya [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 2 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: 5 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round)</li>
</ul>
<p>You wrap yourself in the protective embrace of the wave. Your Armor TN is increased by an amount equal to your Water Ring plus your School Rank for the duration of this spell.</p>
<p><strong>Inari's Blessing [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 2 (Craft)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Created sustenance</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Special (Enough food for 1 additional person per Raise)</li>
</ul>
<p>Inari is the Fortune of Rice, and one of the most beloved of all divine entities throughout the Empire. this spell invokes Inari's blessing, and creates nourishing food and drink at your command. This spell generates enough food and drink to sustain a number of individuals equal to your School Rank +1 for one day. Without Raises, this food is bland but sustaining, such as unflavored rice and water, but with Raises, you can increase the quality of the food to seafood or tea at the GM's discretion. The TN to cast this spell is doubled when in the Shadowlands.</p>
<p><strong>Reflective Pool [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 2 (Divination)</li>
<li>Range: 10 miles</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Body of Water / target location</li>
<li>Duration: 5 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 minute), Range (+10 miles)</li>
</ul>
<p>the inscrutable knowledge of water is a great boon to those who know the means by which it can be invoked. you may stare into a body of water, which may be as small as a puddle, and through it view a familiar location as if you were present, although you can only see what is taking place, not hear it. In order for a location to be familiar to you, you must either have spent a great deal of time there (your home, the dojo, a preferred temple, etc.), or have spent a minimum of ten minutes in meditation at the location. Any body of water can be used for this spell, but since the visions imparted are visual, images depicted will be clearer with larger bodies.</p>
<p><strong>Rejuvenating Vapors [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 2</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Targets (+1 per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>Water washes away all that is impure, refreshing and reinvigorating all it touches. The target of this spell is instantly refreshed as if he had just arisen from a full night's sleep. This does not restore spent Void Points, but can eliminate fatigue and exhaustion. When used on a shugenja, this spell does restore the spell slots associated with the Void Ring (which can be used for any elements), but not the spell slots associated with other Rings. Abilities that characters may use a limited number of times per day are not refreshed by this spell. No individual can benefit from Rejuvenating Vapors more than once within a 24-hour period.</p>
<p><strong>Stand Against the Waves [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 2 (Battle)</li>
<li>Range: 10'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Range (10' per 3 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>A samurai who possesses the speed and strength of the mighty river is a dangerous foe indeed. The target of this spell gains a Simple Action during the Reaction Stage of the current Combat Round. This action may only be used to make an attack. If the target is incapable of making an attack as a Simple Action, this spell grants him a Complex Action instead. This spell cannot aware a shugenja the ability to cast a second spell in the same Round.</p>
<p><strong>The Ties That Bind [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 2 (Divination)</li>
<li>Range: 10 miles</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Range (+2 miles)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the lightest touch forges a connection, and through the spirits of water that connection may be explored. This spell allows you to seek out the spirits of Water within a single, specific object. You must be familiar with the object in question, either having spent a great deal of time around it or handled it personally. If the object is within the range of this spell, you will know the direction and relative distance it is from your current position.</p>
<p><strong>Wave-Borne Speed [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 2 (Travel)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: 2 Rounds</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>The speed of the river can be imparted by knowledgeable shugenja. Your Water Ring is increased by 2 for the purposes of determining how far you may move as part of any Move Actions made during the present Round or the following Round.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom &amp; Clarity [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 2</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+30 minutes), Targets (may target another with 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>By entreating the insight of the Water kami, a shugenja may dramatically increase his ability to perceive the world around him. For the duration of this spell, your reading speed doubles, and you will have perfect recall of everything read while under the influence of this spell. This spell does not enhance comprehension, however, so any language or cipher you are not familiar with is still completely indecipherable.</p>
<h1 id="toc2"><span>Mastery Level 3</span></h1>
<p><strong>Near to Ice [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 3</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual</li>
<li>Duration: 5 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round), Range (increased to 10' with 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>As water grows durable and resistant with the coming winter, so too can the water within the human from become sterner and more durable. The target of this spell has all current Wound Penalties negated for the duration of the spell. Any additional penalties incurred take full effect, using the difference between the negated penalty and the new penalty as the effective penalty incurred. Wounds are not healed by this effect, they simply cease to inhibit those suffering from them.</p>
<p><strong>Regrow the Wound [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 3</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual</li>
<li>Duration: Concentration</li>
<li>Raises: Special (your Water is increased by 1 for the purposes of healing per Raise)</li>
</ul>
<p>Water flows into all things and flows out. In flowing out, it can carry away that which is undesirable. The pain and suffering inflicted by injuries can be channeled away from an individual, and cast into the infinite ocean where they are lost forever. The target of this spell recovers a number of Wounds equal to your Water Ring plus your School Rank each round the spell is in effect. You must touch the target when the spell is cast, but after that it may be maintained without physical contact.</p>
<p><strong>Silent Waters [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 3 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: Variable</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>The memory of the ocean is infinite, and its vast power can lay in wait for a very long time indeed. Upon completion of a successful casting of this spell, you may immediately cast a second spell of any element. This second spell must be a spell you can normally cast, and it must be of Mastery Level 3 or lower. If the second Spell Casting Roll is successful, the second spell is stored within you, and will not activate until a specific physical effect takes place, which you specify at the time of casting. The spell's trigger could be that you speak a certain word, draw a blade, or fall in battle, for example. Whatever the trigger, when it occurs, the second spell immediately takes effect as if you had just finished casting the spell. A character may never benefit from multiple uses of Silent Waters at one time. If the second use of the spell is cast on the same individual, the current &quot;stored&quot; spell is immediately dispelled and replaced with the new one.</p>
<p><strong>Strike of the Tsunami [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 3 (Battle)</li>
<li>Range: 25'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: A cone originating from the caster, 10' wide at end</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Damage (+1k0), Range (+5'), Special (+5 to the Earth Roll TN per Raise)</li>
</ul>
<p>Water is everywhere, and obeys the commands of its favored shugenja. You summon a crushing wave of water that overruns everything in its path. The wave inflicts 3k3 Wounds on everything within the affected area, and all opponents within the area of effect must make an Earth Roll (TN 15) or suffer Knockdown. Obviously, everything within the area of effect is saturated with water.</p>
<p><strong>Visions of the Future [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 3 (Divination)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: 1 minute</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>Although not as reliable as the natural (if extremely rare) gift of foresight or the (equally rare) Void spells that enable divination, this spell still allows powerful visions of the future. It was first developed by the Tonbo family of the Dragonfly Clan, and is found infrequently outside their ranks. The spell requires use of a large pool of still water into which you must gaze. Upon completion of the spell, you enter a brief trance, and see images of things that have not yet come to pass. These images are rarely direct, and tend to by symbolic (violence is depicted as a scene of battle, for instance), but the events foreseen are completely accurate, and will come to pass unless prevented by your direct intervention. Only the shugenja casting this spell may see the events depicted in the vision. Many shugenja believe that use of this spell is a means of thwarting the natural order, and regard both it and those who make use of it negatively.</p>
<p><strong>Walking Upon the Waves [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 3 (Travel)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual (May be the caster)</li>
<li>Duration: 10 minutes</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 minute), Targets (+1 per Raise)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Water kami buoy those who carry their favor and grant them passage. The target of this spell may move across the surface of water as if it were solid ground (Basic Terrain). If the surface of the water is disturbed, as by a storm, rolling waves, or any other similar event, it counts as Difficult Terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Water Kami's Blessing [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 3</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual (may be caster)</li>
<li>Duration: 5 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Special (your Water Ring is considered 1 rank higher per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>By calling upon the clarity of water, you can receive tremendous insight into the world around you. The target of this spell receives a bonus to all his Perception based rolls, whether Trait Rolls, Skill Rolls, or anything else, consisting of additional rolled dice equal to your Water Ring.</p>
<h1 id="toc3"><span>Mastery Level 4</span></h1>
<p><strong>Dominion of Suitengu [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 4 (Divination)</li>
<li>Range: 100 miles</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 2 bodies of water</li>
<li>Duration: Concentration</li>
<li>Raises: Range (+10)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Fortune of the Sea is a wrathful entity, but one who nevertheless blesses those who entreat him properly. This spell, created by the Mantis clan, allows you to peer into a body of water, which must be at least one foot across and one inch deep, and see out of any other body of water anywhere in the Empire, so long as it is within range of the spell. This can be at any point along the seacoast, a lake, a river, stream, or even a puddle, but you must know the location of the body of water you are targeting. you can see everything around that body of water as if you were submerged within it. You cannot hear what is taking place, only see it.</p>
<p><strong>Ebb &amp; Flow of Battle [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 4 (Battle)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: All selected allies within 50' radius of caster</li>
<li>Duration: 5 Rounds</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobility is one of the greatest strengths of Water. In a skirmish or a battle, mobility is key to survival. This spell increases the movement speed of all allies within range. You may choose to exclude specific allies from its effects if you choose. All those affected by the spell may move a distance equal to their Water Ring x 10 in feet as a Free Action (this is normally a Simple Action).</p>
<p><strong>Heart of the Water Dragon [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 4</li>
<li>Range: 25'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Target individuals equal to caster's School Rank (may include caster)</li>
<li>Duration: 1 round per School Rank</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 round), Special (+1k0 healed per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Water Dragon is a benevolent entity, and his blessings are powerful. Any time that a target of this spell suffers damage during the duration, he instantly regains 1k1 Wounds.</p>
<p><strong>The Path Not Taken [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 4</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: 1 day</li>
<li>Raises: Special (gain 1 bonus spell slot per 5 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>No element can match the sheer versatility and adaptability of Water. Prior to casting this spell, you must select one Ring in which you will be temporarily weakened, and one in which you will be temporarily strengthened. Upon successful conclusion of this spell, you may transfer a number of unused daily spell slots from the weakened Ring to the Strengthened Ring. This spell lasts exactly one day, and then the effects are lost.</p>
<p><strong>Strike of the Flowing Waters [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 4</li>
<li>Range: 10'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual (may be caster)</li>
<li>Duration: 1 round</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 Round), Range (+5')</li>
</ul>
<p>Water flows over and through obstacles, and so too can those infused with its energy. The target of this spell may ignore bonus to his opponents' Armor TN conferred by worn armor, spell effects of Mastery Level 3 and below, and other non-Technique mechanical effects. Against non-human creatures who do not wear armor, this allows the target to treat their Armor TN as 5 lower. This spell does not negate the Reduction awarded by armor, nor does it ignore the increase to Armor TN conferred as a result of an individual adopting the Defense or Full Defense Stances.</p>
<p><strong>Symbol of Water [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 4 (Wards)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Special</li>
<li>Duration: Permanent</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>Priests of the kami are capable of inscribing powerful wards that invoke the power of the elements against all who attempt to pass them. A symbol of water can be inscribed on a solid object, most often a door, window, gate, or any other passageway. Anyone attempting to pass through this passageway or otherwise pass through the area is affected by the protective ward, and must succeed at a Contested Roll using their Fire against the caster's Water. Those who fail are affected by a crippling terror, and must immediately roll against a Fear 7 effect. You may only have one Symbol of Water in existence at any time, and Symbol spells of different elements may never affect the same area. This spell may be dispelled by another casting of Symbol of Water from any shugenja, or by destroying the surface where the Symbol was etched.</p>
<h1 id="toc4"><span>Mastery Level 5</span></h1>
<p><strong>Ever-Changing Waves [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 5 (Illusion)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Self</li>
<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 hour)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimate command over Water can allow flesh to flow like liquid. This spell allows you to physically alter your mortal body, changing your shape to match that of another natural creature. While in this form, you keep your Mental Traits. For Physical traits, you keep whichever is higher, yours or those of the animal into which you have transformed. Other natural abilities are gain as well, including natural weapons or sensory abilities. Some traditionalist shugenja sects look down upon this spell as unclean.</p>
<p><strong>The Final Bond [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 5 (Divination)</li>
<li>Range: Special</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target object or individual</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>The greatest bonds can never be broken. This spell allows you to detect the location of one object or individual well known to you, regardless of their location. The object must be one you have spent tremendous amounts of time around, or have handled frequently in the past. If the target of the spell is an individual, it must be someone well known to you, such as a member of your immediate family or a close friend. You instantly known their approximate location, but sufficient to tremendously narrow any search (for example, &quot;the city of Ryoko Owari Toshi,&quot; or &quot;the northern reaches of the Shinomen Mori&quot;). If the target is outside the Empire of Rokugan, the spell automatically fails.</p>
<p><strong>Hands of the Tides [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 5 (Battle, Travel)</li>
<li>Range: 100' radius centered on the caster</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Targets up to the Caster's Water Ring</li>
<li>Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Area (+10'), Targets (+1 per 2 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>The exchange of energy via Water is a simple matter that can ultimately lead to the exchange of flesh as well. Within the area of effect of this spell, you may choose a number of willing targets up to your Water Ring. You may switch the positions among those targets as you see fit, exchanging one for another. At the end of the spell, there must be a person in every position that was occupied when the spell began, but who is located where can vary depending upon the number of people affected.</p>
<p><strong>Power of the Ocean [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 5 (Defense)</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual</li>
<li>Duration: A number of days equal to your School Rank</li>
<li>Raises: Duration (+1 day per 3 Raises)</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the greatest gift Water can bestow requires a powerful shugenja to impart it to others. This spell is a complex ritual that requires an hour to cast, and can only be cast upon a willing target. For the duration of the spell, the target requires no food, drink, or sleep. A number of times during the duration equal to your School Rank, the target may replenish his Void Points as a Simple Action; this is the equivalent of recovering Void Points via a full night of rest. The target also recovers a number of Wounds per hour equal to twice your Water Ring. If the target of his spell is a shugenja, he regains all expended spell slots at sunrise, regardless of whether he has had any rest.</p>
<p>After the spell expires, the target lapses into a state of complete exhaustion. This last for exactly half the duration of the spell effect. During this time, the target cannot take any significant physical action, and can only move about sluggishly. Travel is completely impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Suitengu's Embrace [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 5 (Thunder)</li>
<li>Range: 25'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: Range (+5')</li>
</ul>
<p>The Fortune of the Sea is wrathful, and requires little prompting by his loyal adherents to smite another. By invoking the Water kami, you can fill a target's lungs with seawater, crippling and potentially killing them. If the spell is cast successfully, the target can take no actions other than to attempt to resist the spell. For all intents and purposes, the target is reduced to the Down Wound Level in terms of his ability to take actions. each round he must make a Stamina Roll (TN 15) to resist. If the target makes three total successes, he spends on additional round vomiting up seawater, and then is fully recovered. However, if the target suffers two consecutive failures, he has fallen unconscious and will die within 1 minute unless some form of magical or medical intervention is made.</p>
<p>Although means of combating drowning are not well known in Rokugan, it is possible to save an individual incapacitated by this spell by making a successful Medicine / Intelligence roll at TN 50.</p>
<h1 id="toc5"><span>Mastery Level 6</span></h1>
<p><strong>Peace of the Kami [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 6</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 target individual</li>
<li>Duration: Instantaneous</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>The ultimate benevolence of the Water Dragon is without measure. The target is instantly cured of all diseases, his system purged of any and all poisons, and all Wounds are completely healed.</p>
<p><strong>Rise, Water [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 6</li>
<li>Range: 30'</li>
<li>Area of Effect: 1 summoned spirit</li>
<li>Duration: Concentration</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>The sea itself will take form to defend you. The ultimate actualization of the Summon spell, this spell summons a massive kami of pure water to serve you. It takes the form of a vaguely humanoid shape, roughly ten feet in height, with an outline that constantly shifts and changes due to its fluid construction. The kami may move up to 15' x your Water per round, and saturates the ground in a 20' radius around it, ensuring that all terrain in that area is at least Moderate Terrain (unless it is already Difficulty). The manifest kami is treated as if it has all Physical Traits equal to your Water Ring, and attacks with Jiujutsu Skill Rank equal to half your Water Rank. Damage from these attacks has a DR equal to your Water Ring. For purposes of taking damage, the spirit is considered to have Wounds as though it were a human with Earth equal to your Water Ring, but suffers no Wound penalties. It is Invulnerable. If it is successfully reduced to zero Wounds, it is dispelled.</p>
<p><strong>Water's Sweet Clarity [CR]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 6 (Divination)</li>
<li>Range: Personal</li>
<li>Area of Effect: Target body of water</li>
<li>Duration: 3 rounds</li>
<li>Raises: None</li>
</ul>
<p>The greatest form of augury is one that speaks directly and allows others to witness it. By focusing your energy on a still body of water, you can invoke powerful visions of the future based upon your questions. You may ask one question, and the waters will reveal the answer. The answer takes the form of three separate images, which may be connected in any number of ways, including events occurring over time, or perhaps three facets of a single event. Unlike other forms of augury, others may witness these visions as well.</p>
